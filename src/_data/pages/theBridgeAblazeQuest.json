  "markdown": "{{DisambigMsg|the quest in {{bow}}|the location|The Bridge Ablaze}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsBeastOfWinter/) in {{bow}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nFar younger than the other two echo realms, this is the [Evon Dewr Bridge](/evonDewrBridge/) at the Citadel, frozen in the moment just miliseconds before the Godhammer was detonated. The battle is frozen in time - and the Watcher needs to figure out why.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n*One of the more interesting places in Rymrgand's realm. After taking in the splendor of the area, interact with [St. Waidwen](/stWaidwen/), then reach out to his soul. The following exchange, captured in the moment before the detonation. As you talk to Waidwen, it becomes plain that he is actually trapped in an endless cycle where the last moment of the [Saint's War](/saintsWar/) repeats endlessly. Regardless of what you do, the events will culminate in an explosion again. This will transition into the Moment of destruction, as Eothas was shattered by the Godhammer and just Waidwen was left behind. Collect [Waidwen's Sundial](/waidwensSundial/) from around his neck, then fight off the spirits and talk to [Eothas](/eothas/).\n* Your next task is to collect the fragments of Waidwen buoying this realm and let him become one together. You will need to pass through each moment of detonation to collect 4 pieces of him. The first is located atop the tower to the west, accessed from the entrance in front of the soldiers dying to sunbeams. The next needs to be collected by traveling to the different moments. There are three, each accessed with the Sundial: \n** Dawn: The Moment Before (when you enter)\n** Noon: The Moment Of\n** Dusk: The Moment After (where you landed)\n\n* Using the ray of light before Waidwen and travel to the Moment After (Dusk).  Collect the [Evon Dewr tower key](/evonDewrTowerKey/) from Waidwen’s remains.  Use the portal to transport you to under the bridge. Use the ray of light there to travel to the Moment Before (Dawn) and talk to the priest (it is very difficult to see her) to discover that the detonation mechanism for the bomb, hidden by a powerful illusion spell, was a shard of adra containing a fragment of Waidwen's soul suspended between spiked copper plates. This magical fuze was activated by Waidwen's proximity - a bomb for Waidwen, made ''from'' Waidwen. Exit the door on the left and go to the Tower, using the tower key to unlock the dock. Retrieve the [Memory of Magranite Incantations](/memoryOfMagraniteIncantations/) from a barrel on top and return to the priest. You can extract a fragment of Waidwen's soul - either by detonating the bomb (thus retaining the sequence of events), or using a Magranite Priest/Fire Godlike background or an Explosives 17/Sleight of Hand 15 check to carefully remove it. \n** If you spoke to the chained spirit in the Queries, you can use [Betrayal](/betrayal/) to assume [Durance](/durance/)'s form and force the priest to reveal the construction of the bomb. Then you can imitate Durance (or refuse to do so out of disgust at Durance) and gain the schematics. Disarming the bomb grants you the [Detonator Shard](/detonatorShard/), a little piece of a time paradox.\n*That same ray of light reached through the portl can transport you to the Moment Of, where another Wandering Soul awaits.\n*Then you can use the next ray to travel to the Moment Before, and head to the patch by the area entrance. Access the Moment Of (Noon) to collect some minor loot or to the Moment After (Dusk) to grab the final part of his soul, located under the bridge. \n*The fourth part will reveal that Waidwen was a firm believer - and when faced with the inevitable end of the march, he did not flinch. He finally understood that the kith were supposed to stand against the dawn together, not rely on it (and that Eothas knew about the bomb all along).\n* Return to Waidwen. You can ask him to aid against either [Neriscyrlas](/neriscyrlas/), Eothas or let him just descend into the void and his soul will dissolve. To fight the the dragon you will have to argue with him. Once persuaded he will exclaim \"lead the way\" and exit through a portal. If you convince him to stand with you against Eothas he will accompany the (invisible) trail of souls behind you.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX02_01_Iceberg_Dungeon/LAX02_qst_critical_path_quest_03_godhmr_plane.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Bridge Ablaze'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| I have found myself in another part of Rymrgand's dominion - a tableau of <b>Evon Dewr Bridge</b>, the site of <b>Eothas' destruction</b> by the <b>Godhammer Bomb</b>. \n\nIf I can enlist their aid, the spirits here may be able to help me against <b>Neriscyrlas</b>. \n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| I have found myself in another part of Rymrgand's dominion - a tableau of <b>Evon Dewr Bridge</b>, the site of <b>Eothas' destruction</b> by the <b>Godhammer Bomb</b>. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Investigate the bridge.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Evon Dewr Bridge isn't here by accident.
