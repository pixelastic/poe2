The pommel, which contains a complex web of binding copper and adra, houses a soul from an unknown source. When activated, the soul is released from the emitter only to be pulled back into the adra contacts after traveling a prescribed distance. This disruptive process tears at the edges of the soul, releasing powerful energies along its periphery. The soul is thus caught in a fixed loop that functions as a blade.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 307\n| shop_value        = 1535\n| combat_type       = Weapon\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 3.0\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 11-16\n| damage_type       = Raw\n| weapon_bonuses    = Sharp\n| curr_enchantments = Fine weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Fine;Ethereal Blade\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = Skipping Ahead\n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sabre_U_Animancers_Energy_Blade\n| location          = * [[Spire of the Soul-Seers]]: Loot on a mercenary during the quest [[Skipping Ahead]]\n* Wielded by [[Flaune Elette]].\n| guid              = 2aa24e25-a68a-4a38-9ba4-c6fb88005a37\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sabre}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Animancer's Energy Blade is one of the only weapons that deals raw damage as its base attack.\n* It is also one of the only unique weapons that doesn't have any unique upgrades.",
