This, above all things, was an axiom for Okura, chief galley cook of the Rauatai scout ship Waimara. Any crewman from the ship master to the lowest powder boy could rely on a steady, unending supply of Okura's famous stew. This was because Okura cooked little else. Stew at first watch. Stew at last watch.\n\nOf course, the crew complained. Okura was untroubled. A crew that didn't complain was a crew short on work, if you asked her. She became a fixture of the vessel as captains and crews came and went. Okura and her cast iron pot remained at the ready to feed those under their charge.\n\nWhen the Waimara fell victim to a rogue wave, Okura was lost at sea. The ship was scrapped for parts and its supplies redistributed among the Rauatai navy. The crew, however, stole away Okura's pot. In an act of finality they gave it to a local smith on the one condition he craft it into something, anything, other than a cooking vessel. They then toasted to Okura's memory and hoped beyond hope that whatever her pot became, it would never be used to cook stew again.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Head\n| item_type      = Helm\n| item_category  = Accessory\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 1240\n| shop_value     = 6200\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = Boil Over;Seasoned Iron;Hearth and Home (enchantment){{!}}Hearth and Home\n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Head_U_Helm_Okuras_Kettle\n| location       = * [[The Sacred Stair]]: Sold by [[Tiabo]].\n| guid           = 285d8c45-8844-4cc0-9825-052dc14761e5\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Helm}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
