He was indiscriminate in his violence, preying on merchants and other pirates alike in his quest for treasure and blood.\n\nThe ships of his many victims were often discovered adrift, their decks littered with corpses and the riggings strewn with severed heads. Driven only by his insatiable need to spill blood, Daneric eventually began to forgo even plundering the vessels. As his infamy grew, entire flotillas set sail with the express purpose of hunting down the Claret and her captain.\n\nDaneric’s crew, dissatisfied with a lack of loot and disillusioned with Daneric’s malevolent deeds, eventually sold him out to Vailian pirate hunters in exchange for clemency and a sizeable bounty. When the Vailians boarded, Daneric’s crew turned on their captain.\n\nSalvagers later discovered the Claret floating adrift. The headless bodies of both crews covered the deck. Neither the Vailian frigate nor Captain Daneric were anywhere to be found.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Great sword\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1735\n| shop_value        = 8675\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 9\n| handing           = Two-handed\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 23-31\n| damage_type       = Slash;Pierce\n| weapon_bonuses    = \n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Menace;Red Tear (enchantment){{!}}Red Tear\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Great_Sword_U_Distraho\n| location          = * [[Sayuka]]: Sold by [[Koami]]\n| guid              = f8c79738-854a-434f-ab31-0ee12b3f538b\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Great sword}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Red_Quickening-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|8c768113-18bf-4bd0-a9a2-1b37a63b6755}}\n|effect =Grants [[Red Quickening]] (Allied AoE: +35 Health Restored)\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =991fc9a3-8e0b-48dd-82a0-47e7ae616f60\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =862d2279-7e31-45bf-b790-ae22a481548f\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =d9cc6f16-0616-4b2a-a246-f4a88522ca12\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=71da273c-e424-4374-95ee-b36e59fe26f0\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Nimbus_of_Dread-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|90b748b7-8331-4e71-b721-e8f3b689ee35}}\n|effect =Chance to [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Shaken]] (-5 [[Resolve]], -3 Power level) target and nearby enemies on [[Critical Hit]]\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =1a3ddb58-d3f8-49e9-ae94-6e3ef08ebd72\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =b43f6a5c-9627-426c-b605-e6890a16df0b\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =e474463c-1c74-44c5-945c-385d864b6974\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=b2a74430-bdad-48f3-9076-1289ad38e2ee\n}}\n}}",
