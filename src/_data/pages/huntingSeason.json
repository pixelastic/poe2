  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [side quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsSideQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe port of Sayuka (north of Nekataka) has a conflict with druids native to the island. You can try to end the conflict by helping one of the sides.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This quest starts automatically after visiting the [Sayuka workshop](/sayukaWorkshop/), during the quest [Overgrowth](/overgrowth/). Upon exiting, one of the engineers comes running your way, warning you of an attack on the settlement by a group of Bog Druids. Help defend it by killing all the enemies; Bog Druids leading a pack of [Bear](/bearDeadfire/)s, [Elder Boar](/elderBoarDeadfire/)s, [Tiger](/tiger/)s and [Ice Blight](/iceBlightDeadfire/)s.\n* If you choose, you can also flee Sayuka. This will advance the quest, and the RDC soldiers will take care of the attacking creatures.\n* Once they're taken care of, speak with [Fleet Master Okaya](/fleetMasterOkaya/). She will thank you, and give you {{cp2|500}} - yet another underwhelming sum of money for risking your life. She explains that the druids have attacked the settlement once before, after which a small force was sent to quell them, but they have not returned and are suspected to have been killed. She will ask you to travel to [Bentbranch Bog](/bentbranchBog/) and kill the Druid Leaders yourself.\n\n'''Bentbranch Bog'''\n* Travel to Bentbranch Bog, on the island of Sayuka.\n* Once there, a short cutscene will play during which a delemgan will summon a cluster of Assassin Vines, thus blocking the short path to the Druid Leaders. Take the long road around by venturing north, or try to clear the Vines (take care, as Vines are very strong range attackers and will burst down squishy group members in seconds). Keep in mind that you will most likely have to fight the delemgan as well as the Vines regardless of the path you choose.\n* Reach the Druids in the northeastern corner of the location. There will be four of them: the [Druid of Spring](/druidOfSpring/), the [Druid of Autumn](/druidOfAutumn/), the [Druid of Summer](/druidOfSummer/), and the [Druid of Winter](/druidOfWinter/).\n* Talk to the Druids. You can either attack them outright, or attempt to resolve the situation peacefully.\n** The latter is only available if you are a [Druid](/druid/), [Ranger](/ranger/), have at least 13 [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/), or if you bear the Nature's Mark (received by un-corrupting the tree on [Motare o Kōzi](/motareOKozi/)). The Diplomacy option then also requires that you are a Druid, Ranger or [Nature godlike](/natureGodlike/), otherwise they will simply tell you to leave.\n** With [Tekēhu](/tekehu/) in your party, you can ask him for assistance too, though he sides with the druids ([Worldly](/worldly/) disposition).\n** With [Maia](/maia/) in your party, she will question your choices should you choose to help the druids.\n* Regardless, they do not want to negotiate peace, and instead demand that you kill Fleet Master Okaya.\n\n'''Kill the druids'''\n* You can simply refuse their offer or attack them outright. The fight is relatively tough, and the pair of sigils make it even more so. Once they're dead you can loot them for a substantial amount of Exceptional quality gear, as well as the unique bow [Saint Omaku's Mercy](/saintOmakusMercy/).\n** Alternatively, you can agree to help the druids (which will grant you the bow) then kill the druids so that you can claim the reward from Okaya as well. As a side note, this choice also gives you better field positioning against the druids, which can be a nasty battle if you are ill-prepared since there are so many casters.  \n* Return to Fleet Master Okaya for Major Positive reputation with the Royal Deadfire Company, the unique Blunderbuss [Xefa's Empirical Explication](/xefasEmpiricalExplication/), a Concussion Bomb, 2 Grenades, and 3 Stun Bombs.\n\n'''Agree to help the druids'''\n* If you instead agree to kill Fleet Master Okaya, the [Druid of Spring](/druidOfSpring/) will grant you a unique War Bow, [Saint Omaku's Mercy](/saintOmakusMercy/). If [Maia](/maia/) is in the party, you will lose major relationship (8) for choosing this option. You will, of course, lose Major Reputation with the Royal Deadfire Company if you follow through with the Druids' plan.\n* Return to the [Fleet Master's quarters](/fleetMastersQuarters/) in Sayuka.\n* If Maia was present during the deal with the druids and is still in your party as you walk into the Fleet Master's office, she will betray you, instantly warning Fleet Master Okaya of your plans and becoming an enemy.\n** You can choose to follow through and kill the fleet master. This will please the druids, but the RDC will become permanently hostile against you. Most NPC's in the city will attack you when you leave the building, so be prepared!\n** Otherwise, you can inform Okaya about the Druids' offer for a Reasonable or Honest reputation bonus. She'll still want you to kill them though.\n\n##  Notes \n\n* In an earlier patch, gaining both the bow and the reward from the RDC was only possible if you agreed to help the druids. This has since been changed, as the Druid of Spring will now always drop the bow, making this \"trick\" redundant.\n* The Druids will attack you if you pick any dialogue choice besides upper three ones: Druid check, Ranger check, or 13 Diplomacy. If you can pick any of these, they will make their offer, but you can still refuse and attack them.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/15_Takuro/15_QST_Hunting_Season.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Hunting Season'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| A pack of enraged animals led by a group of <b>druids</b> has attacked the Royal Deadfire Company port of <b>Sayuka</b>.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Defend <b>Sayuka</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| A Royal Deadfire Company soldier warned me that <b>Sayuka</b> was under attack by <b>druids</b> and wild animals.
