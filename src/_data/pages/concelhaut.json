His apprentices spend years in their laboratories, toiling over new enchantments for the privilege of learning at his feet, further enhancing his potential. \n\nConcelhaut is a longtime rival of [Llengrath](/llengrath/) and other archmages ([Ninagauth](/ninagauth/), [Minoletta](/minoletta/), [Kalakoth](/kalakoth/) and [Citzal](/citzal/)) who try or have tried to take him down by any means necessary, including hiring [a mercenary army](/tornBannermen/) that Concelhaut dismisses as merely a nuisance. He is single-mindedly dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and by 2823 AI has four apprentices: [Uariki](/uariki/), [Pelden](/pelden/), [Sabel](/sabel/), and [Tanoss](/tanoss/). He is reluctant to part with anything that might diminish his power, especially the Engwithan phylactery - as it's literally carved into his skull with runes, sealed with a peg of adra, and merged with a complex web of spells.\n\nIn his office is a Sky Dragon eye, suggesting that he may have slain such a beast himself or is at the very least, as powerful as a mature Sky Dragon (though it is questionable whether he would be able to take on an Adra Dragon or an Alpine Dragon in single combat).\n\nHis ultimate goal is to discover time manipulation, as pioneered by Caedebald the Red and Maura of the Seven Hills. To that end, he needs a soul that can draw on the power of the ether: A Watcher's soul.\n\n## ={{game|poe2}}\n\n=\n{{Description|A skeletal figure clutches a scroll in both of his gnarled hands.

His ressurection is unexplained even when the Watcher asks, only that he was delighted in \"slamming the proffered door on the Usher's hand\", referring to [Berath](/berath/).

Other than the Watcher themselves, though players may be tempted to bring along their wizards, e.g., Aloth, for lore and/or role-playing purposes, there is no additional special dialogue associated with this. Concelhaut does have some unique dialogue if the Watcher is a Wizard, and also if the Watcher has a high Lore skill. Care should be taken not to attack him with spells while he has Arcane Reflection up.

For example, using a ranged character to initiate a force-attack on one of his minions, then retreating to the entrance of Concelhaut's chamber will usually result in his minions concentrating in a mob that is susceptible to AoE spells and attacks, while Concelhaut himself is forced to remain behind them, limiting his ability to target and cast his deadly spells. \n\n## ={{game|poe2}}\n\n=\nIn {{poe2}}, he is a tough opponent who uses mind-based afflictions and is surrounded by a number of fairly high-level minions.
