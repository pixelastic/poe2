Vast numbers of ships and people pass through the docks every day, bringing wealth into the city and increasing the Queen's might - and that of her competitors maintaining footholds in the vast metropolis. The [[Vailian Trading Company]] maintains a substantial presence in the district, operating its main luminous adra mill and headquarters.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* Immediately after you disembark, you're accosted by the local harbormaster, [[Kaoha]]. Berath will effectively force you to demonstrate your powers as Watcher and Herald, sending the official fleeing. Now you have access to the entire district. The north-western quarter is where the shipyard is located, staffed by [[Zamar]], with three shops on the way belonging to [[Rebero]], [[Osa]], and a [[hunter]].\n* The central road leading east is overlooked by the [[Valera Estate]], [[Sanza's Map Emporium]], and the [[luminous adra mill]]. The [[Bardatto Estate]] sits above them on an elevated terrace, near the road north, to the upper levels of Neketaka. [[Ivorr the Bright]] preaches in the market square.\n* The plaza overlooking the Peddler's Canal in the south is a [[Vailian Trading Company Headquarters|hive of scum and villainy]], with [[The Wild Mare]] just nearby.\n* A number of small docks dot the canal, allowing goods to be ferried along the water and to the surrounding buildings. A skiff from the [[Undercroft]] will appear on the westernmost dock in front of the VTC HQ, assuming you left the 'croft via boat. From then, it can be used as a quick shortcut between the two areas.\n* The adventurous can visit the Back Alley in the north, especially if they're looking for [[Wanika|Dockside Arms and Armor]] to stock up on tools of war.\n\n===Changes===\n{{Spoiler warning|game=poe2|small=yes}}\n* If you free [[Scyorielaphas]] during [[The Shadow Under Neketaka]], a small section of the map changes. A portion of the beacon/tower near the docks is destroyed, sections of the cobblestone road are turned up, a nearby statue is toppled, and a number of surrounding crates have knocked over (see below).\n* After the bombardment on the district during [[The Final Maneuver]], parts of the VTC HQ roof will be destroyed (though strangely the flag still stands), and the HQ interior will become inaccessible.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Aenia]], local bounty fixer.\n* [[Akema]], an island [[aumaua]] in the district.\n* [[Cotta]], a nasty character from the [[Príncipi sen Patrena|Príncipi]]\n* [[Ivorr the Bright]], preacher of [[Gaun]].\n* [[Kaoha]], harbormaster\n* [[Larro Bardatto]], son of the Bardatto family matriarch\n* [[Nera Bardatto]], daughter of the [[Ezzali Bardatto|Bardatto family matriarch]]\n* [[Orso Valera]], member of the Valera family\n* [[Synbel]], street entertainer.\n* [[Tawenu]], a [[Huana]] in need\n* [[Tiela]], a street urchin\n\n'''Merchants'''\n* [[Cobbler]], boots, misc items\n* [[Hunter]], hunting supplies\n* [[Osa]], fish\n* [[Rebero]], clothing\n* [[Wanika]], weapons and armor\n* [[Zamar]], sells [[Ship upgrades]]\n\n'''During [[Sealed Fate]]'''\n* [[Avetta]]\n* [[Degnos]]\n\n'''During [[A Bigger Fish]]'''\n* [[Shrimp]], crew member of an RDC junk.\n\n'''During [[Family Pride]]'''\n* [[Zili Valera]], another member of the Valera family.\n\n'''During [[Coming to Terms]]'''\n* [[Kalei]], a spy for the [[RDC]]\n\n'''During [[Bounty - Lord Admiral Imp]]'''\n* [[Lord Admiral Imp]], an imp with his gang of Xaurips.\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Badrwn's Cover]], [[Cloak of Deflection]]: Sold by [[Rebero]].\n\n==Pets==\n* [[Abraham]] - \"Wet Dog\": On the [[Luminous Adra Mill]] balcony.\n* [[Toby]] - \"Lost Dog\": On the balcony of the [[Vailian Trading Company Headquarters]].\n* [[Levin]] - \"Neglected Dog\": Behind a skiff in the shipyard.\n\n==Gallery==\n<tabber>\nBuildings = \n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\" style=\"text-align:center\">\nPE2_Vailian_Trading_Company_Headquarters_Exterior.png | [[Vailian Trading Company Headquarters|VTC HQ]]\nPE2_The_Wild_Mare_Exterior.png | [[The Wild Mare]]\nPE2_Valera_Estate_Exterior.png | [[Valera Estate]]\nPE2_Bardatto_Estate_Exterior.png | [[Bardatto Estate]]\nPE2_Sanzas_Map_Emporium_Exterior.png | [[Sanza's Map Emporium]]\nPE2_Luminous_Adra_Mill_Exterior.png | [[Luminous Adra Mill]]\n</gallery>\n|-|\nMap changes = \n'''Changes to Queen's Berth as a result of decisions made during [[The Shadow Under Neketaka]] and [[The Final Maneuver]]'''\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"160px\">\nPE2_Queens_Berth_Dragon_Destruction_before.png | Beacon (before)\nPE2_Queens_Berth_Dragon_Destruction_after.png | Beacon (after)\nPE2_Queens_Berth_Bombardment_before.png | VTC HQ (before)\nPE2_Queens_Berth_Bombardment_after.png | VTC HQ (after)\n</gallery>\n</tabber>",
