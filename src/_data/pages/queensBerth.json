Vast numbers of ships and people pass through the docks every day, bringing wealth into the city and increasing the Queen's might - and that of her competitors maintaining footholds in the vast metropolis.

Berath will effectively force you to demonstrate your powers as Watcher and Herald, sending the official fleeing. Now you have access to the entire district.
