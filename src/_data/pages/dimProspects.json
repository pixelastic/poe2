Return once the deed is done.\n** If you destroyed the pillar, the talk is straightforward. You will receive two lots of Moderate Positive reputation with the RDC, and {{cp2|1250}} for your efforts.\n** Otherwise, you receive a Moderate Negative reputation with RDC. But at the same time, you can also gain Minor Positive reputation by making an excuse:\n*** ''\"Now that I have their trust.

There was nothing I could do.\"'\n\n:: Then he says that the storms around the island have cleared, and asks what you know of it. You get Moderate Positive reputation with the RDC regardless of your answer.\n* Talk to [Hazanui Karū](/hazanuiKaru/) to begin the next quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_RDC_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_RDC01_Poko_Kohara.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Dim Prospects'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Atsura</b> has asked me to thwart the Vailian Trading Company's plans for <b>Poko Kohara</b>.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Disrupt the luminous adra at <b>Poko Kohara</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| <b>Atsura</b>, grand secretary of the Royal Deadfire Company, wants me to impede the Vailians' progress at <b>Poko Kohara</b>.\n\nTo that end, he's asked me to find a way to render the <b>luminous adra</b> there unusable.
