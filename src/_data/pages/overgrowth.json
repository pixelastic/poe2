She will ask you to pay a visit to the recently-arrived [Iverra](/iverra/) at the [workshop](/workshopSayuka/) on [Sayuka](/sayuka/) to find out what they've learned.\n* Upon entering the workshop, Iverra is in conversation with one of the [Coralmason](/coralmason/). They've determined that the wild coral growths are being caused by a source of magical disturbance that lies somewhere in the deep sea to the southeast of the island, the location of [Cignath Mór](/cignathMor/), an old drowned [Engwithan](/engwithans/) ruin. Iverra hands you her masterpiece, a set of [Diving Equipment](/divingEquipment/).\n* Leave the workshop, and you'll immediately be thrown into a yet another problem [Sayuka](/sayuka/) is facing: Bog Druids. This starts [Hunting Season](/huntingSeason/), though it is unrelated to this quest.\n* Leave Sayuka and travel just southeast of the island to a new icon on the world map. Interact with it to dive down to the [Engwithan](/engwithans/) ruin.\n\n###### Cignath Mór\n\n* As you swim down to approach the ruins, you come to a magical barrier, which is holding back the water from consuming the area entirely. and creating a large pocket of breathable air surrounding the ruins.\n* See the main article, [Cignath Mór](/cignathMor/), for a walkthrough on this area. Once you get to the lower level (and after slaughtering a bunch of seafolk) you will find the adra machine, the cause of the coral growths. It is under the protection of [Galawain](/galawain/), who explains that it is feeding the creatures in the area, strengthening them so that they become \"..strong and ruthless - and in so doing, worthy of [his] regard.\" You can do one of two things: \n** Disable the [Engwithan](/engwithans/) machine that makes the corals grow. This will anger [Galawain](/galawain/), who confronts you with a [Kraken](/kraken/) to fight on your way out of the structure. You can loot the unique helm [Mask of the Grotto Deep](/maskOfTheGrottoDeep/) and a [Kraken's Eye](/krakensEye/) off him. This result is preferred by the Fleet Master.\n** Leave the machine operating and disable three pylons to flood the ruins. If you attempt to disable the machine first, [Galawain](/galawain/) promises you a boon for disabling the pylons instead. Once the ruins are flooded, you dive up to your ship; the watcher must pass a [Mechanics](/mechanics/) 9 or [Athletics](/athletics/) 10 check to avoid injury. If [Galawain](/galawain/) promised a boon, the watcher gains [Savage Cunning](/statusEffectsDeadfirePermenentEffects/) (+1 [Perception](/perception/), +2 [Survival](/survival/)). upon returning to the surface. The Fleet Master is unhappy with this result, which leads to a moderate reputation loss with the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/). The reputation loss can be recouped by passing a diplomacy check.\n\n##  Notes \n\n* Disabling the [Engwithan](/engwithans/) machine will gain approval from [Pallegina](/palleginaMesRei/) and disapproval from [Xoti](/xoti/). \n\n## Gallery\n\n###### Diving down to Cignath Mór\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\n RE si open water.png\n 15 si diving helmet.png\n 15 si diving.png\n 15 si ruins approach.png\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_RDC_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_RDC03_Overgrown_Coral.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Overgrowth'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Fleet Master Okaya</b> has asked me to discover the source of a magical disturbance causing the coral in <b>Sayuka's</b> port to grow out of control.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Speak to <b>Iverra</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Fleet Master Okaya told me to talk to <b>Iverra</b>, a Vailian scientist who might be able to help me get to the source of Sayuka's coral problem.\n\nI can find her in the <b>Royal Deadfire Company's workshop</b> in Sayuka.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''5'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Travel to the underwater ruins of <b>Cignath Mór</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10005\n| Iverra believes the source of the coral's overgrowth is an Engwithan ruin, <b>Cignath Mór</b>.
