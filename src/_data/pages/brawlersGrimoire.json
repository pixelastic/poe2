The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Fleet Feet (Deadfire);Concelhaut's Parasitic Staff (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Merciless Gaze (Deadfire);Bulwark Against The Elements (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Ryngrim's Repulsive Visage (Deadfire);Llengrath's Displaced Image (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Essential Phantom (Deadfire);Minor Arcane Reflection (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Llengrath's Safeguard (Deadfire);Citzal's Spirit Lance (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire);Minoletta's Precisely Piercing Burst (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Citzal's Martial Power (Deadfire);Llengrath's Warding Staff (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Temporal Cocoon;Wilting Wind (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Llengrath's Reflection;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Lich_Brawler\n| location       = * Dropped by Ancient Fampyr Sage in [[Fampyr's Crypt]], west of [[Razai Passage]] in the NW section of the map.\n| guid           = c4597f15-200f-4f45-858f-aabdde10d6c6\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
