  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [main quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsMainQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nEothas has been spotted near Hasongo, an island with a Rauataian outpost and an adra lighthouse. Hasongo can be found to the west of Neketaka.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* To complete this quest, you need to head to [Hasongo](/hasongo/) and make your way through the fort to the lighthouse, in order to commune with Eothas again. The adra vein in the lighthouse has gone dark - a sure sign that Eothas drained it, however a nāga named [Sugaan](/sugaan/) bars the way. \n* Sugaan is a treasure trove of information on the past, describing the extinction event that [Ondra](/ondra/) perpetrated on the archipelago. Unlike most kith, the naga have preserved knowledge of the past to a far greater degree than the [Huana](/huana/), and Sugaan believes that history will repeat itself.\n* To convince him to let you approach the pillar to restore it, either:\n** Say ''\"Eothas came to reach the adra, not to punish anyone.\"'' or ''\"I'm a Watcher. I can restore the adra if you'll just let me near it.\"'' then use [Metaphysics](/metaphysics/) 6.\n** Find [Yanass](/yanass/) in the [cannon rampart](/cannonRampart/) and bring her with you. She will convince him on your behalf. If you haven't found Yanass yet, you can still leave and come back later. Sugaan won't attack you if you leave.\n** Ask with steel.\n* Upon interacting with the pillar, you will commune with Eothas, who will commend you on your efforts and shed a little more light on his plans. He will also explain the Watcher's unique position, in knowing the truth about the gods, despite the interference of the Leaden Key and the Hand Occult. With [Metaphysics](/metaphysics/) 4 and [Intellect](/intellect/) 16, you can identify the nature of the soul link, and Eothas will explain that by severing the tether at Maje Island - due to you contacting him - he had to replenish his soul reserves at Hasongo, rather than continuing on to his destination. Before breaking off, he will also return a portion of your soul to you.\n** {{legacy|poe1}} If you sacrificed one of your companions to Skaen's [Blood Pool](/bloodPool/) during the events of {{poe1}}, the part of your soul that housed this memory will be returned to you, and you will be given the [same](/effigysResentment/) permanent boon, granting you a unique bonus depending on the companion sacrificed. Some of these effects differ to account for new mechanics in Deadfire, see [Permanent effects](/statusEffectsDeadfirePermanentEffects/) for more information. \n** {{legacy|poe1}} If you absorbed the souls in the quest [Undying Heritage](/undyingHeritage/) during the events of {{poe1}}, you will be re-granted [Gift from the Machine](/giftFromTheMachine/), giving you +1 [Might](/might/) and +5% Max Health.\n** If you did neither of these things, you will not be granted a bonus.\n* If Sugaan is alive, you can speak to him and can suggest a diplomatic solution. [Maia](/maia/) will insist on not letting him walk away, not after the number of dead Rauataians left behind by the nāga. You can pacify her, and she will [dutifully](/dutiful/) comply. Sugaan will also thank you for showing him two new things: Restoring the adra and mercy on part of kith. He gives you the unique amulet [Strand of Favor](/strandOfFavor/).\n* Next stop, [Ashen Maw](/ashenMaw/). As you leave Hasongo, you will be greeted by an RDC fleet with Grand Secretary Atsura, who will congratulate you and recommend heading to Neketaka.\n\n## God conversation\n\n* Shortly after completion of [A Distant Light](/aDistantLight/) on Hasongo, the Watcher will commune with [Berath](/berath/) and the other gods regarding [Eothas](/eothas/)' intentions. This interaction occurs as a random event while sailing, sometimes immediately after leaving the port.\n* {{legacy|poe1}} The gods comment on a number of your actions in {{poe1}}, including:\n** [Berath](/berath/): The outcome of [A Servant of Death](/aServantOfDeath/), whether you killed [Rehstin](/rehstin/) and [Erona](/erona/) to end their avoiding The Wheel (see [Histories](/historiesAServantOfDeath/)).\n** [Wael](/wael/): The outcome of [The Parable of Wael](/theParableOfWael/), whether you returned the scroll to [Grimda](/grimda/) or lost it for Wael (see [Histories](/historiesTheParableOfWael/)). If you returned the scroll, Wael will <u>destroy all scrolls</u> in your stash as punishment.\n\n* Your choices of dialogue during this conversation will determine which upgrade to [Visage of Death's Herald](/visageOfDeathsHerald/) (or its upgrades) the Watcher receives. It is also dependent on the last upgrade to this ability you received during the god interaction following [Stranded](/stranded/) on [Port Maje Island](/portMajeIsland/). The final upgrade occurs after [He Waits in Fire](/heWaitsInFire/).\n* A score is tallied representing the amount of times the Watcher made a response of a particular Disposition. Each disposition is associated with an upgrade to [Visage of Death's Herald](/visageOfDeathsHerald/) (and its upgrades). You must choose at least 2 of the dialogue options for the associated ability, and your final \"score\" must be greater than that of the other two scores, with exceptions - see below.\n* Each upgrade adds an [Inspiration](/statusEffectsDeadfireInspirations/) which is granted to the Watcher when using the ability. Diplomatic responses give a Perception Inspiration, Sassy gives Intellect, and Aggressive gives Might. If the ability already grants that Inspiration type, the Inspiration is upgraded to the next tier. For example, [Insightful](/statusEffectsDeadfireInspirations/) (Tier 1) would become [Aware](/statusEffectsDeadfireInspirations/) (Tier 2).\n\n## =Upgrades\n\n=\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:20px\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | Death's Herald upgrade matrix\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | \n! colspan=\"4\" | Upgraded from\n|-\n!
