The port of Crookspur lies on the eastern side of an island northwest of Neketaka.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n{{Note|Failing this quest means you will not be able to side with the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/) during [The Coming Storm](/theComingStorm/) / [The Final Maneuver](/theFinalManeuver/). This should be kept in mind if you decide to help [Master Kua](/masterKua/) during [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/)!}}\n* After completing [Overgrowth](/overgrowth/), [Fleet Master Okaya](/fleetMasterOkaya/) will request that you speak with [Atsura](/atsura/) back at [Imperial Command](/imperialCommand/). Atsura explains that the RDC wants the slavers on Crookspur Island gone, and it's your job to make that happen.\n* This is a quest that can be tackled in a variety of ways, but ultimately requires purging the slavers from the island. For a detailed walkthrough, see the quest [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdPropositionAgainstCrookspur/).\n** If you return to Atsura after completing [Tip of the Spear](/tipOfTheSpear/) you will automatically fail the quest and will receive major negative reputation with the RDC. Doing so will mean that you are no longer able to side with [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/) during [The Coming Storm](/theComingStorm/) and [The Final Maneuver](/theFinalManeuver/).\n** However if you return to Atsura after killing [Master Kua](/masterKua/) (regardless of if you had completed Tip of the Spear or associated quests), you will '''not''' fail the quest. This is the only way to do both Furrante's side of A Shrewd Proposition (and extended quests), and Clearing Out Crookspur.\n\n###### After killing Master Kua\n\n* After leaving Crookspur, you will be greeted by yet [another](/fromTheWreckage/) RDC fleet. This time, you will meet [Kana Rua](/kanaRua/) (he unfortunately is not voiced), who is tasked with securing the port of Crookspur against pirates and slavers. Kana will reminisce your adventures together in the Dyrwood, during {{poe1}}. Make sure to swap [Maia](/maia/) into your party for some added spice.\n* Return to [Atsura](/atsura/) in the [Imperial Command](/imperialCommand/) - Lower. You can question the RDC's haste sending warships to swoop in on Crookspur\n* After this quest, the Royal Deadfire Company will occupy Crookspur. This occurs 12 hours after handing in the quest.\n\n## Kana Rua dialogue\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Dialogue\n!
