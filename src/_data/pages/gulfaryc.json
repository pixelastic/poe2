On 2 Fonivèrno, 2827, the day of his sixtieth birthday, he departed the Empire to seek of a legendary mace blessed by [Woedica](/woedica/) herself, the Magistrate's Cudgel. Together with three other veterans, [Arnfryda](/arnfryda/), [Carmet](/carmet/), and [Blidh](/blidh/) he set out to the [Deadfire Archipelago](/deadfireArchipelago/), traveling it up and down to find a single clue as to where the mace can be located. Finally, on 17 Majestu, they picked up its trail, leading to a long-forgotten [subterranean temple](/subterraneanTemple/) to [Woedica](/woedica/), where they found the [Magistrate's Cudgel](/magistratesCudgel/) perched in the lap of the statue. The mighty soul of the mace compelled them to stay and protect it, lest it be carried away from its resting place. So they stayed, old men and women basking in the glory of the Exiled Queen, sustained by what little they could find on the island. <ref>[Gulfaryc's Journal](/gulfarycsJournal/)</ref>\n\n## Interactions\n\n{{Interactions\n|companion       =\n|wares           =\n|stronghold      =\n|rest            =\n|quests_started  =\n|quests_involved =\n|none            = x\n|other           =\n}}\n{{references}}",
