  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTheForgottenSanctum/) in {{lax3}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n[Tayn](/tayn/) wants the Watcher to liberate the captive kith in the Collections wing of the Halls Obscured with a scroll that he created. The scroll will reinsert memories stripped from the kith into their minds. The catch? They will be inserted at random. Tayn dismisses the problem as entertaining, but [Llengrath](/llengrath/) is horrified by the idea and would rather the Watcher put the captives out of their misery.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n'''''Important note on Llengrath's scroll:''' If you plan on using [Llengrath's scroll](/llengrathsScrollOfFinalSlumber/) to euthanize the prisoners, be aware that this includes [Bekarna](/bekarna/). If you want her to live and complete her quests, you must first restore her mind by completing [Wasting Minds](/wastingMinds/), i.e. bringing her the book [Advanced Wistful Stargazing](/advancedWistfulStargazing/).''\n\nThis quest requires the player to reach [The Assembly of Echoes](/theAssemblyOfEchoes/) in the Collections wing first and defeat the Memory Hoarder. After it's gone, the player can then use the aperture and choose either Tayn's or Llengrath's resolution:\n\n* Reading Tayn's spell will cause the souls to be provided with unpredictable minds and memories. Upon returning to Tayn, he will also reveal that he packed the spell with a little something that will cause the prisoners to be extra talkative, hopefully spilling the Hand Occult's hidden secrets.\n* Reading Llengrath's spell will euthanize the souls and return them to the Wheel.\n* It's also possible to collect a special egg from the machine by reaching down into the mouth of the instrument. The egg will hatch into a pet, [Retina](/retina/), upon returning to the Temple of Revelation.\n\n* Completing the quest increments trust with the chosen archmage and access to the Godseed quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX03_Forgotten_Sanctum/lax03_qst_02_tayn_01.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''A Shout in the Dark'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Tayn wants me to liberate the captive kith in the Collections wing of the Halls Obscured.
