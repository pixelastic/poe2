Accounts suggest the thieves did not make it off the island of Kazuwari, but are hiding west of the Crucible in an area of Kazuwari known as the [Whakupoko Lowveld](/whakupokoLowveld/)\n* After reclaiming from the stelgaer-ridden depths of the Whakupoko Lowveld (see page for details), donate the artifact to the [Pool of Memories](/poolOfMemories/).\n* This will unlock three challenges that focus on brute force and savagery. After conquering these duels, you will face off with the final challenge, the Dragonstalkers,  another pack of contenders spilling blood in the name of the Slayer. Disposing of them completes the quests and leads to you being chosen as the Slayer's champion.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX01_00_Arena_Island/LAX01_00_qst_face_slayer.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Slaying Face'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| If I want to secure the favor of the Slaying Face, I will need to attend to the bloodthirsty statue's demands and find victory in the <b>Crucible's Slayer challenges.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Recover the <b>Slayer's artifact</b> from <b>Whakupoko Lowveld.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Thieves have stolen an <b>artifact sacred to the Slayer</b> from the Crucible archives.\n\nAccounts suggest the thieves did not make it off the island of Kazuwari, but are hiding <b>west of the Crucible</b> in an area of Kazuwari known as the <b>Whakupoko Lowveld.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Return to the <b>Pool of Memories.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| I have reclaimed the artifact of the Slayer from the stelgaer-ridden depths of the Whakupoko Lowveld.\n\nOffering this artifact to the <b>Pool of Memories</b> should allow the Crucible to manifest new challenges based on the memories clinging to it.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''3'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Wreak havoc in the <b>Beasts of the Slayer</b> series of Crucible arena events.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10003\n| Now that I've offered the Slayer's artifact to the Pool of Memories, I am deemed worthy of facing the Slayer's challenges.\n\nIf I wish to continue gaining the favor of the Slaying Face, I will need to <b>compete in these savage duels.</b> When I'm ready, the Pool of Memories will ready the Crucible for battle.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20000\n| I crossed paths with another pack of contenders spilling blood in the name of the Slayer - the Dragonstalkers.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''4'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''<b>Defeat the Dragonstalkers</b> and become the chosen of the Slaying Face.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10004\n| Victory in the Crucible arena has earned me the favor of the Slaying Face.\n\nOnly one other pack, the <b>Dragonstalkers,</b> is of equal standing in the flashing eyes of the Slayer.
