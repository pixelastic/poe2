  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [faction quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsFactionQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nDirector Castol has a contact among the Príncipi, Captain Furrante, who is apparently in a position to aid certain Vailian trade prospects on the island of Crookspur.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Upon finishing [Dirty Laundry](/dirtyLaundry/), Director Castol has yet another matter he needs your assistance with, concerning one [Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/) of the [Príncipi sen Patrena](/principiSenPatrena/). Castol knows that it's ironic that he should now be the one associating with the Principi, but assures you that it's in the interests of the Company. He tells you to meet up with Furrante to assist him with problems they're having with a hostile tribe (referring to the Wahaki tribe on [Ori o Koīki](/oriOKoiki/)).\n* This quest requires completing [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/), and by extension [Tip of the Spear](/tipOfTheSpear/), by siding with Captain Furrante and assisting [Master Kua](/masterKua/) and the slavers. Visit Furrante in the [Balefire Beacon](/balefireBeacon/) to start, and return to him when it is complete, then finally return to Castol. You will gain Moderate Positive reputation with the VTC.\n* Otherwise, if you freed the slaves and/or wiped out Crookspur, Castol will be flustered, but will understand that you did as you saw fit, even though it might not have been for the betterment of the company. You will gain Minor Positive reputation with the VTC.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_VTC_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_VTC04_Slavers.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Of Like Minds'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Director Castol</b> has a contact among the Príncipi, <b>Captain Furrante</b>, who is apparently in a position to aid certain Vailian trade prospects on the island of <b>Crookspur</b>.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| <b>Castol</b> has a wealthy contact among the slavers of <b>Crookspur</b>.
