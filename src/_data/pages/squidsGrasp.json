Azio \"Calmo\" (Squid) was a man of cruel humor and dogged determination. The captain of the red-sailed sloop Cirono's Mercy, his own crew feared him as much as his foes. He survived four mutiny attempts, each time miraculously reversing the circumstances of an ambush. Legends spread of the wicked pirate captain with eyes in the back of his head and a rapier the color of ink.\nWhen travelers saw a Príncipi flag, they breathed sighs of relief when the ship attached to it was not Azio's. Though the other captains of the Príncipi wanted to reprimand the Squid for his excessive cruelty, they, too, feared his wrath.\n\nOne of the Príncipi captains, Bernetta, eventually set sail with her ship, Wave-Breaker, to parley with Azio and pass on the concerns of the others. Days later, another Príncipi ship found the Wave-Breaker abandoned - save for a box containing Bernetta's severed head and the suolenets of the crew.\n\nThough Azio had escaped the pirate hunters for years, it was the murder of Bernetta that turned the Príncipi against him. Within weeks, hunters had sacked many of Azio's secret hideouts and plundered his reserves. The Príncipi who caught sight of Cirono's Mercy avoided the ship and their ports provided him no shelter.\n\nEventually he was set upon by the Vailian caravel Pliambo Pumo and the Rauataian gunship Black Reef near the Mala Kumo tribe's village. The captain of the Pliambo Pumo, Cisensa, ordered her men to board and led the Vailian charge. Azio's crew, sensing that this would finally be the end of their cruel captain, were quick to surrender. Meanwhile, Azio had leapt into the shallow waters near the Mala Kumo village and frantically swam to shore. Unfortunately for Azio, tales of his wickedness had reached even this small circle of Huana. Before the tribe's Mataru closed in, the Mala Kumo's Storm Speakers pummeled Azio with magic. Staggered by the onslaught, the pirate was unable to draw his rapier and the Mataru quickly overpowered him.\n\nEach group that aided in Azio's defeat tells a different story about his demise. The Vailians say he was handed over to his crew, who stomped him to death on the deck of Cirono's Mercy. The Rauataians say he was lashed to the mouth of a cannon on the Black Reef and blown to pieces. Mala Kumo elders say that the Mataru carried him into the deep water for Ngati to drag into her bosom.\n\nWhat is known for certain is that Cisensa successfully bartered with the Mala Kumo for Azio's distinctive black steel rapier. When the Pliambo Pumo went missing in 2171 AI, it was assumed that Azio's rapier was lost forever. It reappeared in a Huana market in 2173 AI and has been circling the Deadfire ever since. Rumors claim that each bearer is cursed to die within a year of holding it.}}",
