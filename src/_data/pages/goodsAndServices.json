  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/quest/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nMad Morena, the Príncipi captain who runs the Undercroft in the Gullet, has a buyer seeking crude luminous adra at black market rates, but she has no stock to sell. The Watcher needs to obtain some crates for her if I want to earn her favor.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nThis quest can be easy or hard, depending on how rich you are. To skip it, you'll need to have {{cp2|30,000}} in your pocket, otherwise you'll have to find the [crates](/crateOfCrudeLuminousAdra/).\n\n* Start the quest by either talking to [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/) or [Captain Mad Morena](/captainMadMorena/).\n\n* You receive a [Wine and Gunpowder-Scented Letter](/wineAndGunpowderScentedLetter/) from [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/), inviting you to a parley at [Fort Deadlight](/fortDeadlight/). The letter arrives when you:\n** Received the quest [Symbols of Death](/symbolsOfDeath/) and left [Dunnage](/dunnage/).\n** Or completed the quest [Blow the Man Down](/blowTheManDown/), waited to receive the [Letter of Fine Penmanship](/letterOfFinePenmanship/) from [Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/) when returning to the world map about 2 days later, then similarly waited for another day.\n* Talk to Aeldys at Fort Deadlight, she will then send you to Mad Morena.\n* According to Morena, the Vailian Trading Company has a stockpile of crude luminous adra at their mill in [Queen's Berth](/queensBerth/), or you can ambush the Company's boats at sea as they ship the adra out of Neketaka.\n* The amount of crates you need depends on Morena's mood:\n** Three crates for being sent by Aeldys.\n** Four crates normally.\n** Six crates for annoying her.\n* At the [Luminous Adra Mill](/luminousAdraMill/), you can either buy the crates directly from [Cortina](/cortina/), or steal them from a number of containers scattered throughout the mill.  Stealing the crates requires a bit of luck, and will be easier using a character with higher [Stealth](/stealth/).\n* Alternatively you can pirate the crates from the [VTC](/vtc/) ships leaving [Neketaka](/neketaka/). 2 crates are guaranteed to drop from all VTC ships while the quest is active.\n* If stealing isn't your thing, Cortina will be willing to sell you the adra at a varying price if you can convince her. You will need to buy the full number of required crates, even if you have already obtained some by other means.\n**{{cp2|2000}} per crate - At least 3 Reputation with the Vailian Trading Company, asking for the company to return the favour.\n** {{cp2|1500}} per crate - At least 3 Reputation with the Vailian Trading Company, and [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 6. \n** {{cp2|1500}} per crate - [Bluff](/bluff/) 9, convince her that the purchase may be the first of many.\n* Return to the Captain and hand them in.\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you are sent by [Aeldys](/captainAeldys/) you can get the sabre [Tarn's Respite](/tarnsRespite/) three times. This is one of the best early [sabres](/sabresDeadfire/) you can find, and is equal to the [Superb Sabre](/superbSabreDeadfire/) in [Penetration](/penetration/).\n** While the Goods and Services quest is active, take the first bounty from [Barati](/barati/), a low-level VTC ship, and sink one more VTC ship. You will get two crates of luminous adra from each. Take these to Morena for your first sabre.\n** The Luminous Adra Mill has six more crates, but steal just three at a time, making two more trips to Morena to get two more sabres.\n** Each time you bring luminous adra to Morena and say, \"I've got the luminous adra,\" you get the same dialogue and a sabre. Although the reward each time includes Major Positive: Principi sen Patrena and Moderate Positive: Delver's Row Criminals, the second and third rewards don't seem to add anything to your reputation. Experience points are only given for the first delivery.\n** If you were not given the quest by Aeldys you can only get two sabres at four crates each.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/06_Neketaka_Slums_District/06_QST_LuminousAdra_Hunt.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Goods and Services'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Mad Morena,</b> the Príncipi captain who runs the <b>Undercroft</b> in the Gullet, wishes to sell crude luminous adra at black market rates.
