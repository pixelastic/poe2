Arkemyr saves only the most tedious errands for me. If I'm not going to learn anything from this trial, I must find some way to steal enjoyment from it.\n\nWhenever Arkemyr claims to be \"deep in study\" I will find him wandering the halls wearing an illusory face to trick his imps. Fools them every time. Sometimes I think he came to the Deadfire to be alone with those nasty things, and he spites me for getting in the way of his fun.\n\nShortly after he left town, I stole one the robes he keeps in his bedroom. The imps thought I was their master. Fed me cheese and ale for the rest of the afternoon. Of course I returned the robe when I was done. Ac, maybe it's not too late to start enjoying myself.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Journal\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = The Archmage's Vault\n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_Fessina_Journal\n| location       = * [[The Dark Cupboard - Living Quarters]]: On the shelf to the right of the window.\n| guid           = dcafa8e1-1a71-462c-add6-e39ae3b27d41\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Journal}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Usage==\n* Contains a clue as to the whereabouts of [[Arkemyr's Old Robe]], which can be used to trick the imps roaming the manor into thinking you're their master.\n* Alludes to the passphrase \"cider and cheese\", though you'll need to read [[Arkemyr's Notes]] to actually use it.",
