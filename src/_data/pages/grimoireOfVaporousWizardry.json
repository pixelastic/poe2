The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 1700\n| shop_value     = 8500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Minoletta's Minor Missiles (Deadfire);Thrust of Tattered Veils (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Binding Web (Deadfire);Necrotic Lance (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Fireball (Deadfire);Expose Vulnerabilities (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Minoletta's Concussive Missiles (Deadfire);Confusion (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Malignant Cloud (Deadfire);Call to Slumber (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Chain Lightning (Deadfire);Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Delayed Fireball (Deadfire);Wall of Draining (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Kalakoth's Freezing Rake (Deadfire);Wilting Wind (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Meteor Shower;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = Volatile Casting\n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Backer_Grimoire_of_Vaporous_Wizardry\n| location       = * [[Periki's Overlook]]: Sold by [[Fassina]] in [[The Dark Cupboard]].
