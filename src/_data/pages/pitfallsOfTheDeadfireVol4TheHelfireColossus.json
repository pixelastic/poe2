One passage stands out:\n\n\"Animancers visiting from afar- do NOT seek out Dorudugan, the iron TYRANT, for academic research. DEATH will surely follow.\n\nWhoever created this FIRE-SPITTING BEHEMOTH is responsible for the CALAMITOUS INFERNO it has wrought on the isles. The Society is unaware if the ironclad's creator died at its hands, but JUSTICE itself would demand that they be vaporized by the very flames they so RECKLESSLY stoked.\n\nThe Deadfire Visitor's Preservation Society takes no responsibility for harm inflicted by knowing ignorance of the risks, and every effort has been made to keep travelers AWAY from the following coordinates: 38° 37' S 31° 21' E.\" \n\nA map of the Helfire Colossus' position is marked off with a wax seal in the shape of a skull. It points toward a desert wasteland in the southwestern corner of the Deadfire Archipelago.\n| added_in       = laxg1\n| added_in_cat   = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Book\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 16\n| shop_value     = 80\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 1 - The Crystal Empress;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 2 - The Voracious Mountain;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 3 - Sigilmaster Auranic;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 4 - The Helfire Colossus\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = MISC_Mega_Boss_Chronicles_Volume_4\n| location       = * [[Queen's Berth]]: Sold by [[Sanza]] of [[Sanza's Map Emporium]].\n| guid           = 289ab65b-ee94-45a1-9e96-5f5911d81f8a\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [[book]] in {{poe2}}.\n\nIt was added in {{laxg1}}, and warns readers of the perils of [[Dorudugan]] - conveniently providing its exact location.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
