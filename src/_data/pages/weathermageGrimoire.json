  "raw": "{{Infobox item poe2\n| name           = Weathermage Grimoire\n| icon           = poe2 grimoire13 icon.png\n| description    = A grimoire is the lifeblood of any wizard's magical repertoire. These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.\n\nIt is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.\n\nThough all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Chill Fog (Deadfire);Jolting Touch (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Bulwark Against The Elements (Deadfire);Miasma of Dull-Mindedness (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Kalakoth's Minor Blights (Deadfire);Crackling Bolt (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Pull of Eora (Deadfire);Dimensional Shift (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Blast of Frost (Deadfire);Ninagauth's Bitter Mooring (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Ninagauth's Freezing Pillar (Deadfire);Chain Lightning (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Llengrath's Warding Staff (Deadfire);Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Wilting Wind (Deadfire);Kalakoth's Freezing Rake (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Concelhaut's Corrosive Skin;Llengrath's Reflection\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Weathermage\n| guid           = 205a79cf-0f66-4f6c-8dca-6911d4eee07a\n| location       = * [[Bounty - Ikorno]]: Looted from [[Ikorno]]\n* Looted from [[Mercenary Wizard]] on the [[Spire of the Soul-Seers]] rooftop during the quest [[Skipping Ahead]] (after you return from the second experiment).\n* Looted from the Ruined Tower in the [[Kua o Rikuhu Islands|Kua o Rikuhu]] island chain (random chance)\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
