They take to the sand at midnight and scuttle around my feet - as hungry as the rest of us, I say. The work is difficult enough without them pinching my ankles and going after the prize.\n\nI thank Ngati for every day that Ruānu does not ask.\n\nThe shore warms by day and cools by night. If this will get the job done, then even Kohopa may forgive me. Only at midnight can I check. Some day the tribe will know what I do, but until that day... ekera, no one may know.\n\nIn the meantime, I say the beach is so lonely.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Journal\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_Rongi_Journal\n| location       = \n| guid           =bf9ee0f4-557a-457f-a7b6-fc14b1ff2210\n\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Journal }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
