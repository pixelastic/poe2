The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Jolting Touch (Deadfire);Fan of Flames (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Combusting Wounds (Deadfire);Rolling Flame (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Crackling Bolt (Deadfire);Minoletta's Bounding Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Flame Shield (Deadfire);Minor Grimoire Imprint (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Call to Slumber (Deadfire);Form of the Helpless Beast (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Chain Lightning (Deadfire);Arcane Reflection (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Substantial Phantom (Deadfire);Delayed Fireball (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Wall of Many Colors (Deadfire);Temporal Cocoon\n| level9_spells  = Petrification;Minoletta's Missile Salvo\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Aloth_Grimoire\n| location       = * Equpped by [[Aloth]].\n| guid           = 9280df5f-b181-4783-89f4-0eab8601acef\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
