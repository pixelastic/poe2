The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Arkemyr's Dazzling Lights (Deadfire);Wizard's Double (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Curse of Blackened Sight (Deadfire);Miasma of Dull-Mindedness (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Kalakoth's Minor Blights (Deadfire);Arduous Delay of Motion (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Confusion (Deadfire);Dimensional Shift (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Arkemyr's Wondrous Torment (Deadfire);Ryngrim's Enervating Terror (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Arkemyr's Capricious Hex (Deadfire);Minoletta's Precisely Piercing Burst (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire);Ninagauth's Killing Bolt (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Major Grimoire Imprint (Deadfire);Kalakoth's Freezing Rake (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Arcane Cleanse;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Lich_Illusion\n| location       = * Dropped by Ancient Lich Battlemage in the [[Collapsed Coal Mine]].\n| guid           = f0403e7f-2b84-46fd-bb50-98d3826eb199\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
