  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nXoti is chasing Eothas throughout the Deadfire while striving to fulfill her purpose to Gaun. Apparently a wayward Child of the Dawnstars, she's asked me to help her shepherd the souls of the dead. But her duty may come with a price. As a priestess of Gaun, it's Xoti's god-given duty to harvest the souls of the dead by shepherding them into the light of her lantern.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nXoti's quest is progressed as she collects souls (see list below). Eventually, however, you will realize that Xoti struggles with the increasing burden of the many souls she's harvested for her god, in the form of nightmares. Your choice to guide her towards a path of light or darkness affects her [end-game slides](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireEndingsXoti/).\n\n'''1st conversation'''\n# Xoti will have new dialogue after collecting enough souls. During this conversation Xoti shows these traits: [Piety](/piety/), [Dutiful](/dutiful/) and [Pride](/pride/).\n# Your response will affect her traits.\n## ''\"We can relight the lanterns of Hel, given enough time. All is not lost.\"'' → +1 Light\n## '''OR''' ''\"You're being called to a higher purpose, Xoti. Embrace the harvest - the darkness of the fall.\"'' → +1 Dark\n# She will tell you she wants to try a cleansing ritual before the carved statue in the [Temple of Gaun](/templeOfGaun/). Hopefully it may lighten her darkening mental state.\n\n'''2nd conversation'''\n# Head to the [Temple of Gaun](/templeOfGaun/) in [The Sacred Stair](/theSacredStair/) and interact with the statue in the temple.\n## Note: During this conversation, Xoti shows these traits: [Piety](/piety/), [Dutiful](/dutiful/) and [Progressive](/progressive/). Also, the very first dialog will give a -3 reputation hit with Edér, so you may want to remove him before this update if you want to max their relationship.\n# Your response will affect her traits.\n## ''\"What if you didn't collect souls anymore?\"'' → +1 Light\n### Note: This option also gives a -3 reputation hit with Aloth and a -2 reputation hit with Xoti.\n## '''OR''' ''\"You should amass as many souls as you can before it's too late.\"'' → +1 Dark\n\n'''3rd conversation'''\n# Find more souls for reaping. After collecting them, Xoti will get another, even worse waking nightmare. During this conversation Xoti shows these traits: [Piety](/piety/) and [Dutiful](/dutiful/).\n# You first have a choice to affect her traits:\n## ''\"It was just a dream, Xoti. It'll be all right.\"'' → +1 Light\n## '''OR''' ''\"Endure it. We need all the presage we can get - whatever your visions can offer us.\"'' → +1 Dark\n# And then a second choice which may also affect her traits:\n## ''\"You're losing your light to the darkness. Rekindle it by helping the living.\"'' → +1 Light\n## '''OR''' ''\"Maybe the desire would ebb if you killed someone... close to us.\"'' → +1 Dark\n## Note the other three choices (\"Shrug\", \"Sounds like a problem\", and \"Your nightmares getting worse?\") will not give her light or dark points.\n# You can either offer to bring Xoti to a vein of luminous adra or suggest to entrust the souls to the animancers in the [Spire of the Soul-Seers](/spireOfTheSoulSeers/).\n''Bug:'' If you interact with the animancer's experiment before this step, Xoti's quest may appear as incomplete in your journal, even after finishing it.<ref>https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/107500-lantern-of-gaun-doesnt-complete/</ref>\n\n'''Final conversation'''\n# Either talk to [Flaune Elette](/flauneElette/) or interact with a luminous adra pillar (one is near Flaune). Either way, whether you go to the animancers or not - the outcome does not change as it is dependent on your previous dialogue with Xoti.\n## If you had consistently pushed her to either the light or dark the outcome is already determined. Whatever you say at this point won't change anything.\n## If you had been inconsistent and chosen a mix of light and dark choices, she will do the opposite of what you say (telling her to keep the souls will make her release them and vice versa).\n# During this conversation, Xoti shows these traits: [Piety](/piety/), [Impassioned](/impassioned/) and [Pride](/pride/).\n## '''Warning:''' Xoti will receive an [injury - System Shock](/statusEffectsDeadfireSystemShock/). You'll get the same injury if you try to help her.\n# There are two outcomes:\n## If Xoti chose the dark, the death side of Gaun, the souls will be kept in her lantern, she experiences a revelation, putting her at peace with the dreams yet giving some ominous dialogue about reaping feeling \"painfully good\". You receive [Luminous Adra Mantle](/luminousAdraMantle/), can be used for upgrade '''Threshing Aura''' of [Xoti's Lantern](/xotisLantern/).\n## If Xoti chose the light, the rebirth side of Gaun, the souls will be released, her dreams stop, and she will thank the Watcher for making her \"lighter\". You receive [Luminous Adra Mantle](/luminousAdraMantle/), can be used for upgrade '''Light of the Dawnstar''' of [Xoti's Lantern](/xotisLantern/).\n\n## List of harvestable souls\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
