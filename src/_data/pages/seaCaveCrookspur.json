There's a small crystal spider nest here with minor loot. To access the fortress, you need to go through the iron bars. To do this, you need a [[prybar]], high Might, a Corrode ability, an orlan in the party to reach through the bars, or a Wizard with the spell Form of the Helpless Beast, turning one of your party members into a piglet to open the way. You can also use the exit in the north to leave the fortress and explore the island.\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Fine Pollaxe (Deadfire)|Fine Pollaxe]]: On a corpse in the tunnel to the south.\n\n==Gallery==\n;Getting past the barred gate to [[Crookspur Fort]]\n<gallery mode=nolines>\n 14 SII iron bars 01.png\n 14 SII iron bars 02.png\n 14 SII iron bars 03.png\n 14 SII iron bars 04.png\n 14 SII iron bars 05.png\n 14 SII iron bars 06 lever.png\n</gallery>",
