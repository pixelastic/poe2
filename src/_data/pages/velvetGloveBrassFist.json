[Fassina](/fassina/), the clerk at the Dark Cupboard, needs the gloves returned before she gets in deep water with her master. There's no telling where Bertenno will try to fence the gloves, but he has an appointment to keep at the Brass Citadel docks.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* As you enter [The Dark Cupboard](/theDarkCupboard/), you will witness [Bertenno](/bertenno/) stealing the gloves and making a run for it. If you promise help, Fassina will ask you to track him down and explain why the constructs didn't remove his legs for stealing (''really'' poor choice of lovers).\n* Bertenno can be found in the dock area of [The Brass Citadel](/theBrassCitadel/). Before speaking to him, you can pickpocket the gloves or kill him (the guards will not care, just make sure you don't hit any bystanders with area-of-effect attacks). Otherwise, approach him and demand the gloves. He has had no luck in fencing them successfully and is set to meet [Hamuto Stoneheel](/hamutoStoneheel/) in just a few minutes. During the conversation, Hamuto arrives on the scene and assumes you're a mercenary or negotiator hired to get Bertenno out of his debt. You can silence Bertenno with an aggressive option for a minor positive gain with RDC.\n** You can offer to buy out Bertenno's debt, which constitutes {{cp2|400}}. Hamuto will accept this and Bertenno will give you the gloves, then flee to hide out with the [Principi](/principiSenPatrena/).\n** You can let him take Bertenno away for \"indentured servitude\". Note that Hamuto will take the gloves, unless you buy them back ({{cp2|100}}) or use [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 1 / [Arcana](/arcana/) 1 / [Insight](/insight/) 1 / [Wizard](/wizard/) / [Rogue](/rogue/) to convince him that taking Arkemyr's property is... unwise.\n** You can fight for Bertenno, which will result in a moderate drop in reputation with the RDC. Hamuto is backed by several soldiers and fights to the death. Like with buying the debt, Bertenno will give you the gloves and flee.\n* Return to Fassina.\n** You can give her the gloves, ransom them back, or lie and keep them.\n** Depending on how you resolve the quest, there are a lot of fun lies you can tell her if you want to play with her emotions. She will be distraught if you tell her Bertenno died or was taken into servitude, and happy if you say he walks free.\n** If she gets the gloves back, she will give you a discount on items in her shop (regardless of the method used).\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/05_Neketaka_Artisans_District/05_QST_Arkemyr_Apprentice.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Velvet Glove, Brass Fist'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| A Vailian named <b>Bertenno</b> stole Rokowa's Fingers, a pair of expensive gloves belonging to the wizard Arkemyr. <b>Fassina</b>, the clerk at the <b>Dark Cupboard</b>, needs the gloves returned before she gets in deep water with her master. \n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| I retrieved a pair of fine gloves from a would-be thief in the <b>Dark Cupboard</b>.
