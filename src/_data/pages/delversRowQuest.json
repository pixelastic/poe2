  "markdown": "'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [task](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTasks/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n{{Description|Hidden deep in the belly of the Gullet hides Delver's Row. Cloaked from prying eyes, criminals and black market traders here peddle their illicit goods.}}\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* The goal of this task is simply to find [Delver's Row](/delversRow/). Speak to [Prince Aruihi](/princeAruihi/), [Pitli](/pitli/), or [Enoi](/enoi/) to start the quest.\n* A number of people in [The Gullet](/theGullet/) will give you leads (including [Pitli](/pitli/), [Enoi](/enoi/), [Sedūzo](/seduzo/), and the Beggar by the west exit), which ultimately all lead to [Fyrna](/fyrna/), who you've been told has the exact details.\n* Head to [The Hole](/theHole/) and talk to [Fyrna](/fyrna/). She's baffled that you'd want to go to such a dangerous place, and says that it's somewhere within the labyrinthine passageways known as [The Narrows](/theNarrows/).\n** If you have at least Good (1) reputation with The Gullet, she trusts you, and will continue to give you directions.\n** Otherwise she's hesitant to tell you any more out of fear for Dereo's wrath. You can convince her with:\n*** [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 2, to reassure her that no one will question her loyalty.\n*** Bribe her with {{cp2|250}} (or {{cp2|100}} if you have [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 3).\n* Another option is to show [Fyrna](/fyrna/) the [Envoy's Badge](/theEnvoysBadge/).\n** [Intimidate](/intimidate/) 2. Minor negative reputation with [Delver's Row](/delversRow/) Criminals.\n** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 3. Minor negative reputation with [Delver's Row](/delversRow/) Criminals.\n** Give her {{cp2|400}}. Minor positive reputation with [Delver's Row](/delversRow/) Criminals. [Resourcefulness](/resourcefulness/).\n* Last option, if you already have access to [Dereo the Lean](/dereoTheLean/) (see [Dereo's lair](/dereosLair/)), speaking to him after acquiring the [Cornett of Waves](/cornettOfWaves/) (during [The Cornett's Call](/theCornettsCall/)) will allow you to ask for directions. Doing so will start the quest if it wasn't already started.\n\n'''Finding Delver's Row'''\n* The Narrows can be entered from the southwestern point of The Gullet, and can be explored at any time. They aren't very complex, so it's pretty easy to stumble upon the entrance to Delver's Row by chance, even without knowing the directions. Either way, enter the Narrows, turn right, then go forward until you reach a merchant stall.\n** If you didn't get the directions from Fyrna, you'll need a Watcher-only [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 6 or [Perception](/perception/) 18 upon inspecting the stall, in order to reveal the entrance hidden behind the curtain. This check is repeatable, so you can come back once you meet the requirements.\n** If you got the directions from Fyrna or Dereo, you'll know what to look for. The checks needed to discover the hidden passage will be waived.\n* Proceed through the curtains behind the stall, only to be approached by a trio of hooded thugs. They demand a toll in order to proceed. Your options are:\n** Pay the toll of {{cp2|50}}.\n** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 4 - Convince them that open markets are vital to a healthy economy, and that they shouldn't turn away customers who are willing to pay for the many goods and services in Delver's Row.\n** [Bluff](/bluff/) 3 - Tell them that you've already paid the toll to a man with a scar.\n** Attack - This puts you in a staging area used specifically for the fight, and you lose minor reputation with Delver's Row Criminals.\n** You may also freely pass with the following conditions:\n*** ''\"Dereo the Lean granted me safe passage.\"'' - During (or after completing) [The Cornett's Call](/theCornettsCall/), after returning the [Cornett of Waves](/cornettOfWaves/) to Dereo, he grants you passage in order to access the Undercroft.\n*** ''[Show the suolenet.]'' - You have stolen the [Marked Suole](/markedSuole/) from [Overseer Hitenga](/overseerHitenga/), an item mentioned in the quest [All Aboard](/allAboard/).\n* Finally, exit to Delver's Row in order to complete the quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/06_Neketaka_Slums_District/06_TSK_Delvers_Row.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Delver's Row'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Hidden deep in the belly of the Gullet hides <b>Delver's Row</b>.
