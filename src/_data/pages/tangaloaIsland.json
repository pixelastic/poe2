It is contained in the group of islands known as the [[K창ngati Islands]], located south of [[Maje Island]] at the coordinates 37째 12' S, 40째 50' E.\n\n==Background==\nThis desert island is largely deserted, save for the derelict Temple of Tangaloa. In recent years it was the site of a tragedy as the ''Imposter's Lament'', an Aedyran ship, crashed on its shores. With no relief coming, the crew turned to cannibalism, consuming each other and spawning a terrifying cult of maneaters shielded by spirits of their dead.\n\n==Locations==\n* [[File:Icon Ruins Stairs.png|50px|left]] '''[[Temple of Tangaloa ruins]]''': A temple dedicated to a particularly fun cult that focused on mutilation, torture, and wholesale murder. Fun for the whole family.<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Points of interest\n* [[File:Icon Old Battleground.png|50px|left]] '''Amira's Whisper''': A former battlefield at the gates to the Temple of Tangaloa. Without ... ability, or else having Xoti in your party, you will be forced to confront the darkness, which consists of [[Elewys]] and several spirits. You do get [[Elewys' Locket]] from it, though.<br clear=\"left\" />\n* [[File:Icon Fairy Ring.png|50px|left]] '''Strange Mushrooms''': East of Amira's Whisper.<br clear=\"left\" />\n* [[File:Icon Treasure.png|50px|left]] '''Treasure''': To the north of the ruins.<br clear=\"left\" />\n* [[File:Icon Oasis Large.png|50px|left]] '''Oasis''': East of the landing point.<br clear=\"left\" />\n* [[File:Icon Flotsam.png|50px|left]] '''Flotsam''': Just off the coast, south of Amira's Whisper.<br clear=\"left\" />\n\n==Trivia==\n* This island is present in the [[Backer Beta]].",
