By her feet, a colorful bird preens itself without concern. Maia is an officer of the Rauataian navy, currently under the command of [Hazanui Karū](/hazanuiKaru/) and working for the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/). Unfortunately, that means that she spends more time protecting diplomats and mingling with the snakes from the Republics, something she and [Ishiza](/ishiza/) absolutely detest.\n\nFor Maia, the campaign in the Deadfire is a sort of homecoming, as the senior Ruas emigrated from the Deadfire to Rauatai, catching the ranga nui's eye with their unique talents. As honored guests, her family was one of the few Huana to rise to prominence, although there were moments when the cultural differences came to the fore - such as when the ranga nui's guests checked under the table to see if Maia had a tail. Still, growing up in the ranga nui's shadow wasn't a bad thing overall. Maia and her siblings had excellent tutors and advisors at their disposal while mingling with many strange and exotic folk. \nShe is the sister of [Kana Rua](/kanaRua/) and loves her big brother dearly. However, she hates it whenever he waxes poetic, as his deep bass voice is distracting to her sensitive ears.\n\nMaia herself chose a military career and learning to shoot, while her siblings pursued more academic goals. \nIn fact, that's how she met Ishiza. After winning a royal shooting competition, she received freedom of the royal aerie to choose any of the war birds there. Ishiza wound up as her feathered partner after he kicked a hawk off her arm, just to have her all to herself. Since then, she has served in the Rauataian Navy with distinction, under a variety of officers and banners. Her first kill was a pirate captain, made in the middle of the most impossible conditions which cemented her reputation in marksmanship.\n\nHer latest posting with the RDC benefits from her accumulated military experience and loyalty to her adopted homeland.\nGrand Secretary [Atsura](/atsura/) plans to use that loyalty to further the Rauataian goal of occupying the Deadfire, using her skills as a sharpshooter to eliminate priority targets - or aid other operatives in preparing their own operations.\n\n## Interactions\n\n{{Interactions\n|companion       =x\n|wares           =\n|stronghold      =\n|rest            =\n|quests_started  = [The Courier's Calling](/theCouriersCalling/)\n|quests_involved =\n|none            = \n|other           =\n}}\n\n## =Quests\n\n=\n* [The Courier's Calling](/theCouriersCalling/): Maia was entrusted by Grand Secretary [Atsura](/atsura/) with missives to deliver to RDC agents across Deadfire and asks you to help her in that endeavor.
