Another author appears to have made several hasty additions.\n\n\"To our valued customer,\n\nOn behalf of the dedicated staff of the Consignment and Salvage Clearinghouse, we thank you for expressing interest in the purchase of (1 mail vest, enchantments unknown, previous owner Magnera Freetrader).\n\nUnfortunately, our licensed dealer, (Rimo Caldera, salvage marker 56221), informed us (item unavailable, delivery to be carried out by Captain Henqua but shipment interdicted by pirate hunters, vessel sunk). This is most regrettable.\n\nEnclosed is your original payment of (Vailian trade bullion, amount undisclosed, minus ten percent finder's fee). We certainly hope you will consider future business with us, despite this setback.\n\nSincerest regards, Rowen Gjakon, shipping quartermaster, CaSC\n\nDealer notes, if any: (not certain if vest went down with Henqua. Will make further inquiries.)\"\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Document\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_Marihi_Invoice\n| location       = \n| guid           =d11360e6-62c0-42ca-b3e2-b7fe9598c1e1\n\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Document }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
