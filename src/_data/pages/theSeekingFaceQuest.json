If you return with some [token of the lost petitioners](/tokenOfTheLostPetitioners/) that came before, you will earn the favor of the Seeking Face.\n* Deep within the Kōhatekana Expanse is the skull of a deceased explorer glowing with soul energy (see location article for details). To advance the quest, return this artifact to the the [Pool of Memories](/poolOfMemories/), that the Crucible might absorb the memories imparted on this item and forge battles out of those impressions.\n* Placing the skull in the Pool unlocks the Seeker's path, a series of battles that are less about fighting fair than overcoming foes through cunning. If you're victorious, you will earn the continued favor of the Seeking Face.\n* The final challenge is the Quiet Five pack that also seeks the favor of the Seeking Face. The final step is returning to the Hall of Memories  to determine what further trials await.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX01_00_Arena_Island/LAX01_00_qst_face_seeker.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Seeking Face'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| If I want to secure the favor of the Seeking Face, I will need to attend to the mysterious statue's demands and find victory in the <b>Crucible's Seeker challenges.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Find an <b>artifact of the Seeker</b> in the <b>Kōhatekana Expanse.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Many would-be-seekers go missing in the Kōhatekana Expanse - a dense forest on the <b>west coast of Kazuwari.</b> If I return with some <b>token of the lost petitioners</b> that came before me, I will earn the favor of the Seeking Face.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20000\n| The Kōhatekana Expanse, on the west coast of Kazuwari, is overrun with spiders, the chosen animal of the Seeking Face.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20001\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Return to the <b>Pool of Memories.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| Deep within the Kōhatekana Expanse I uncovered the skull of a deceased explorer glowing with soul energy.\n\nI should return this artifact to the <b>Pool of Memories,</b> that the Crucible might absorb the memories imparted on this item and forge battles out of those impressions.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''3'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Pursue victory in the <b>Seeker's Path</b> series of Crucible trials.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10003\n| I've recovered an artifact of importance to the Seeking Face and offered it to the Pool of Memories, qualifying me to compete in the Seeker's challenges.\n\nI can now <b>compete in the Seeker's path,</b> a series of battles that are less about fighting fair than <b>overcoming foes through cunning.</b> If I'm victorious, I will earn the continued favor of the Seeking Face.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20002\n| I crossed paths with another group of contenders seeking the Seeker's approval - <b>the Quiet Five.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''4'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''<b>Defeat the Quiet Five</b> and become the chosen of the Seeking Face.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10004\n| My exploits in the Crucible have earned me great standing in the many eyes of the Seeking Face.\n\nOnly one other pack, the <b>Quiet Five,</b> is of equal standing.
