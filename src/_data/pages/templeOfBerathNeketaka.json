Devotees and acolytes prepare bodies for burial, while the high priest attends to the rites of worship, preparing to pass his mantle on to someone more worthy - a death godlike, who is the only appropriate priest of Berath in his view.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* A straightforward area: Preparation terrace to the left, main chamber with the impressive decorations straight ahead.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[High Priest Kasu]]: Starts the quest [[Eulogy for the Dead]].\n\n==Loot==\n* You can loot the bodies on the preparation tables for a pair of [[Amulet of Health (Deadfire)|amulets of health]].\n* The locked ([[Mechanics|Difficulty]] 7) and trapped ([[Necrotic Lance (Deadfire)|Necrotic Lance Trap]]) chest in the giant serpent skull contains a number of potions and books.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=200px>\nPE2_Temple_of_Berath_Exterior.png | Building exterior\n</gallery>",
