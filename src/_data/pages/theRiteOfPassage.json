See also [Pool of Memories](/poolOfMemories/).\n\n## Synopsis\n\n{{Description|I've been thrust into the Crucible - some kind of arena competition pitting me against spirits and kith alike. I need to learn about the Rite of Passage I've found myself taking part in.}}\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n## = Intro \n\n=\nYou'll either face the first challenge or talk with [Humaire](/humaire/).\n\n## = Speak with Humaire \n\n=\nYou have to talk with [Humaire](/humaire/). You'll find her on the west side of the map. After small talk you'll tasked with few challenges. It is possible that this will happen after the first challenge.\n\n## = Challenge 1 - Agony of the Elements \n\n=\nThere are few enemies in this challenge.:\n* [Obelisk of Air](/obeliskOfAir/)\n* [Obelisk of Earth](/obeliskOfEarth/)\n* [Obelisk of Fire](/obeliskOfFire/)\n* [Obelisk of Water](/obeliskOfWater/)\n* [Tyrant of Decay](/tyrantOfDecay/)\nFocus obelisks first starting with [Obelisk of Air](/obeliskOfAir/). Those are weak to fire damage. After taking down the obelisks, kill the boss once its destructive aura is down.\n\n## = Challenge 2 - Trial of the Nāga \n\n=\nThat's a fight against several enemies:\n* 2 [Flame Nāga Marauder](/flameNagaMarauder/)\n* [Flame Nāga Archer](/flameNagaArcher/)\n* [Flame Nāga Sorcerer](/flameNagaSorcerer/)\n* [Fire Nāga Totem](/fireNagaTotem/)\n* [Poison Nāga Warrior](/poisonNagaWarrior/)\n* [Poison Nāga Skirmisher](/poisonNagaSkirmisher/)\n* [Poison Nāga Shaman](/poisonNagaShaman/)\n* [Poison Nāga Totem](/poisonNagaTotem/)\n\nYou'll want to focus totems first. Nagas use them to summon additional enemies - [drake](/drake/)<nowiki/>s and [bog ooze](/bogOoze/)<nowiki/>s. Then [Poison Nāga Shaman](/poisonNagaShaman/), [Flame Nāga Archer](/flameNagaArcher/), [Poison Nāga Skirmisher](/poisonNagaSkirmisher/) followed by [Flame Nāga Sorcerer](/flameNagaSorcerer/) and then the rest. You'll want to kill excessive adds through the fight if your team can't take some additional damage.\n\n## = Challenge 3 - Memories of a Mad Man \n\n=\nTo unlock the third challenge, you have to offer an artifact - [Bloodied Ceremonial Obsidian Knife](/bloodiedCeremonialObsidianKnife/) - at [Pool of Memories](/poolOfMemories/). Then you can start [Memories of a Mad Man](/memoriesOfAMadMan/).\n\nYou'll fight several enemies again:\n* [Maerwald](/maerwald/)\n* 2 [Nightmare Shade](/nightmareShade/)\n* At least 1 [Soul Mirror](/soulMirrorEnemy/), whose reflect your current party\nYou'll want to focus [Maerwald](/maerwald/) first. He's a caster and will inflict a lot of damage but also he's also fragile so will go down fast. If you have a tough party members reflected by [Soul Mirror](/soulMirrorEnemy/)<nowiki/>s, then leave them as last to kill (until their damage output is enormous). After [Maerwald](/maerwald/) is dead, focus any remaining casters and then go for other party members and [Nightmare Shade](/nightmareShade/)<nowiki/>s.\n\n## = Challenge 4 - The Bloodletting \n\n=\nYour enemy is [Pipiltin](/pipiltin/)'s party:\n* [Mercenary Fighter](/mercenaryFighter/)\n* [Mercenary Monk](/mercenaryMonk/)\n* [Mercenary Barbarian](/mercenaryBarbarian/)\n* [Mercenary Rogue](/mercenaryRogue/)\n* [Pipiltin](/pipiltin/)\n[Pipiltin](/pipiltin/) does little to nothing so any melee character can handle him through the fight. Remaining members of your party should take out [Mercenary Rogue](/mercenaryRogue/) and [Mercenary Monk](/mercenaryMonk/). There's high chance that [Mercenary Barbarian](/mercenaryBarbarian/) will die from your cleave. If not, take him out next. Finish the fight with [Mercenary Fighter](/mercenaryFighter/) and [Pipiltin](/pipiltin/).\n\nAfter completing the fight, you are given the choice of how to deal with the lingering soul energy:\n* Return it to the Crucible and the wildlife of Kazuwari: Gain the [Galawain's Gift](/galawainsGift/) talent (+2 Accuracy against Beasts).\n* Channel it into Muātu, empowering him: Improve the active ability of [Muātu's Head](/muatusHead/) (speculation).\n* Absorb it for yourself: Gain a single [Culmination Stone](/culminationStone/).\n* Send it back to the Wheel: No immediate gain, but might contribute to the \"good\" ending.\n**The Watcher attempt to return the souls to the Wheel, but is unable to do so. It seems something blocks the way to the Beyond.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX01_00_Arena_Island/LAX01_00_qst_main_quest_02.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Rite of Passage'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Humaire</b> requested that I take part in the Crucible so that I can discover what's behind the unquiet souls stirring across Kazuwari.\n\nBefore I can take part in the full range of challenges the arena has to offer, I'm required to fight my way through the traditional <b>Rite of Passage.</b>\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40002\n| I've been thrust into the Crucible - some kind of arena competition pitting me against spirits and kith alike.\n\nI need to learn about the Rite of Passage I've found myself taking part in.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Begin the <b>First Challenge</b> by communing with the <b>Pool of Memories.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| Humaire seems concerned that the locals of Kazuwari will take offense to my presence if I don't participate in their sport.\n\nShe says I can begin my first foray into <b>the Crucible</b> by using the <b>Pool of Memories</b> on the <b>west side of the temple</b> beneath the arena.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''3'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Seek the <b>Second Challenge.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10003\n| Humaire worries that the <b>souls of Kazuwari</b> are ill-at-ease and hopes that, as a Watcher, I can interpret their needs.
