The blade was polished steel and the basket hilt made from a jackdaw with feathers silky and black as jet. He presented it as a wedding gift to his betrothed - Liela, a druid of storms.\n\nOn their wedding day, Aldris presented his beloved with the weapon. After the vows, Liela imbued the blade with the power of storms, etching her husband's name along the fuller in glowing green runes.\n\nThe celebration was short lived. Under a blackened sky the procession came under attack by the dreaded Captain Crow, commander of the Storm Raven, and his band of cutthroats. Liela attempted to defend her beloved, but she and Aldris were cut down. The buccaneers sacked the wedding and killed all who resisted.\n\nIn the years that followed, Captain Crow used the blade of Aldris to cut a bloody swath through the Deadfire, killing and plundering, wielding the weapon's lightning with abandon. The sabre's powers, unchecked by its cruel wielder, eventually scorched the feathers and flesh from the jackdaw and stained the blade with its victims' blackened blood.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1357\n| shop_value        = 6785\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 3.0\n| penetration       = 9\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 18-27\n| damage_type       = Slash\n| weapon_bonuses    = Sharp\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Storm Blade;Corvid's Bounty\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sabre_U_Aldris_Blade_of_Captain_Crow\n| location          = * [Lair of the Ancient](/lairOfTheAncient/): Northwest area, in the dragon's hoard.\n| guid              = 41186485-49e7-43bd-a869-a7c7076b360b\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sabre}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n##  Description \n\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n##  Acquisition \n\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n## Upgrades\n\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Blood_Honed-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|c37cae87-43d0-4461-9612-1353111ac7de}}\n|effect =10% of Hits converted to [Crit](/crit/)s\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =862d2279-7e31-45bf-b790-ae22a481548f\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =0e274db1-566d-46c8-b485-4392e0c9553f\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =3ca52b87-0531-4402-a3e3-bf4b56847387\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n}}",
