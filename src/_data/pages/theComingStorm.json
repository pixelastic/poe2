  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nIn this phase of the main quest, you need to ally yourself with one of the four [factions](/factions/) in order to be able to reach [Eothas](/eothas/) at [Ukaizo](/ukaizo/). The quest concludes after you finish the final faction quest of your chosen ally. \n\nIf you don't wish to ally with a faction (or manage to antagonize all four factions), you can try to reach Ukaizo on your own.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nCompleting this quest requires you to follow one of the options below, in which you will decide who gets [Ukaizo](/ukaizo/). The quests are mutually exclusive and when you talk to the faction leaders you will be asked to commit to their quest. In certain cases you can back away if you have good reputation with them, otherwise they may turn hostile. If you choose one of the \"go it alone\" options, no faction will control Ukaizo.\n\n###### Options\n\n#[Taking Out the Traders](/takingOutTheTraders/) ([Huana](/huana/)): Return Ukaizo to the Huana and start a war between the trading companies. To achieve this, the Queen wants you to blow up the powder store at the [Brass Citadel](/brassCitadel/) and pin the blame on the Vailian Trading Company.\n# [The Final Maneuver](/theFinalManeuver/) ([Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/)): Hazanui Karū is ready to seize control of the archipelago by assassinating the Queen.\n# [A Vote of No Confidence](/aVoteOfNoConfidence/) and [Sabotage at the Brass Citadel](/sabotageAtTheBrassCitadel/) ([Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/)): The VTC plans to eliminate Rauatai from the archipelago... right after the matter of directorship is decided.\n# [Honor Among Thieves](/honorAmongThieves/) and [A Dance with Death](/aDanceWithDeath/) ([Príncipi sen Patrena](/principiSenPatrena/)): First, the matters of leadership need to be attended to, then you can reach Ukaizo with the [Floating Hangman](/floatingHangman/).\n# Go it alone (prepare your ship): If you choose to go at it alone, you will need the [Dragonwing Sails](/shipUpgradesSails/) and the [Blackwood Hull](/shipUpgradesHull/). Otherwise, the storm of Ondra's Mortar will sink your ship.\n# Go it alone (take the Floating Hangman): Yet another option is to complete A Dance with Death up to the point of obtaining the undead galleon, and then proceed to Ukaizo without reporting back to the Principi leader at Dunnage. Since you do not ally with the Principi unless you report back to Dunnage with the undead galleon, this method will allow you to travel to Ukaizo without allying with any of the factions.\n\n## =Gods meeting\n\n=\nThe gods will elect to meet you when you set sail again. They will be having an argument, particularly between [Woedica](/woedica/) and [Magran](/magran/). The argument covers the steps the gods should take against Eothas, including the option of possessing their godlike children or killing them to empower themselves. Then they will task the Watcher with entering Ukaizo - and warn against the [Guardian of Ukaizo](/guardianOfUkaizo/) left behind by [Engwith](/engwith/), their progenitors. Then you're dismissed after they ask for your opinion.\n\n## Strongest rival\n\nThe faction you help the most and don't align with is identified as your '''strongest rival'''. This faction will confront you at Ukaizo after completing '''The Coming Storm''' and will be factored into the end-game slides. If you sail to Ukaizo alone, the strongest faction will confront you, instead.<ref>[Talk:The_Coming_Storm](/talkTheComingStorm/)</ref>\n\nThe strongest rival is determined by completing these quests or taking these actions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
