His favorite was Wicked Beast, a most ill-tempered and half-blind mongrel. She would snap at everone, including her master, and her will could not be bent like the other dogs.

Such was her belligerence that Aedhor took to wearing a thick glove to pet the hound.\n\nEven as the hound aged her temper never waned, though her health diminished.
