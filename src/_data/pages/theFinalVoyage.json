  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \n{{Description|A peculiar captain by the name of '''Lofell''' claims to have come across a dire threat far to the '''south-east of Neketaka''' A threat that stole away the crew of his ship, the '''Antelope'''.}}\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n{{Note|Starting [A Paradise of the Mind](/aParadiseOfTheMind/) before starting this quest will cause it to be unobtainable (see notes below)}}\n* In order to complete the quest, you need to find Lofell's missing crew members. This is done by completing the first part of the quest [A Paradise of the Mind](/aParadiseOfTheMind/), a summary of which is below.\n* After talking to Lofell, leave Neketaka and head for [Splintered Reef](/splinteredReef/) at the southeastern corner of the map. The area is a wasteland of shipwrecks inhabited by undead. The residents are under the effects of a spell which makes them believe that they're regular kith. Head to [The Pickled Eel](/thePickledEel/) and talk to [Copperhead](/copperhead/) to find out more. After the conversation, [Zulka](/zulka/) and her crew enter the inn with a pair of captives, who are promptly carted to the back room.\n* In order to get to the captives, you'll need to kill [Zulka](/zulka/) and her crew (along with the rest of the inn's inhabitants, who are commanded to attack as soon as you're spotted by Zulka). Alternatively, if you complete the quest A Paradise of the Mind by making a deal with [Menzzago](/menzzago/), Zulka and her crew will no longer be present, allowing you to approach the captives freely.\n* Talk to the two captives in the back room. You can examine the iron collar on them using [Arcana](/arcana/) 15 to determine that the collars possess a similar incantation to the marks on the foreheads of the undead. Doing this, or talking to [Copperhead](/copperhead/) in the boatshed allows you to tell them what is going on. The female captives mentions that they were sailing under Lofell and his ship, the ''Antelope''. After being attacked by [The Floating Hangman](/theFloatingHangman/), they (herself, [Kesango](/kesango/), and [Daimo](/daimo/)) were taken captive by the crew of undead and were brought back to the reef.\n* Tell them to flee (either through the hole in the ship, or through the front door if it's been cleared - it doesn't matter). They will supposedly return to [Fort Deadlight](/fortDeadlight/), netting you moderate positive [reputation](/reputation/) with the [Príncipi](/principi/).\n\n## Notes\n\n* Returning to Fort Deadlight as the captives suggest doesn't have any effect.\n* You can free the captives without ever having talked to Lofell. Doing so does not start/complete the quest if you have not already started it.\n* [Captain Teryc Lofell](/captainTerycLofell/) only appears in [Serpent's Crown](/serpentsCrown/) if a number of conditions are met (see his page for more info). One of the conditions is that [A Paradise of the Mind](/aParadiseOfTheMind/) must '''NOT''' have been started or completed, which is a requirement for the captives to appear.\n* Given the above, starting the quest [A Paradise of the Mind](/aParadiseOfTheMind/) makes this quest ([The Final Voyage](/theFinalVoyage/)) unobtainable. Therefore, the only way to start/complete this quest is to talk to Lofell before journeying to the Splintered Reef.\n* If you encounter Lofell after freeing the captives, the quest will be started and completed immediately after finishing his conversation, however this is impossible without cheats.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/04_Neketaka_Palace_District/04_QST_Crew_of_the_Antelope.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Final Voyage'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| A peculiar captain by the name of <b>Lofell</b> claims to have come across a dire threat far to the <b>south-east of Neketaka</b>.
