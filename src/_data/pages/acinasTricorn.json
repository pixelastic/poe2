Raised among ravenous beasts and carnivorous plants, the young dwarf took to the arbalest and arquebus shortly after she learned to walk. By the time she went to sea, she was one of the quickest shots around with either.\n\nThe impulsive Acina soon fell in with a ship granted a letter of marque by the Vailian Republics to counter Pr√≠ncipi predation in the Deadfire. Though she earned her repute by the speed and accuracy of her shots, pirates around the region knew her almost as well for this hat, a sharp piece of headwear preserved with the fastidiousness born of the knowledge that few things pose greater danger than equipment ill-maintained.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Head\n| item_type      = Hat\n| item_category  = Accessory\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 456\n| shop_value     = 2280\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = Shootist \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Head_U_Hat_Acinas_Tricorn\n| location       =\n*[[Tikawara]]: Sold by [[Vektor]], at the Tikawara Trading Post\n| guid           = 9e05616f-b9be-4875-a9a3-034953ca3d8d\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Hat}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n==Description==\n{{Description|{{#var:description}}}}\n\n==Location==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
