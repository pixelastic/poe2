She greatly enjoys their grand libraries, which she considers to be the republics \"true treasures\".<ref name=\"pe2_vailia_dialog\">Ydwin on Vailian Republics: ''\"The Republics take the most progressive attitude towards the subject, and thus they attract its foremost scholars.

So I sought out the source.\"''</ref>\n\nAs well as being an animancer she is also a talented seamstress, finding that the two practices have more in common than one might think. She enjoys adopting pieces of culture from other nations and has a near perfect Vailian accent.\n\n## =Animancy\n\n=\nAfter decades of study, Ydwin has became an expert in the [metaphysics](/metaphysicalConcepts/) of Eora and is a skilled practitioner of [animancy](/animancy/).\n\nAs an apprentice, she focused on discrediting animancy phrenological studies and the idea that some kith are more desirable soul vessels than others. She then became interested in theoretical ideas, before taking an interest in the study of parapsychological inertia - or \"the tendency for some souls to gravitate towards familiar locals or engage in behaviors exhibited from past lives.\" Following that, she moved on to meta-mortality - or \"the scientific study of souls over lifetimes and the cycle of reincarnation.\"<ref name=\"pe2_research_dialog\">When asked about her area of study: ''\"As an apprentice, I focused on - and then helped discredit - the phrenological approach.\"'' and ''\"Some of my - colleagues - had a vested interest in a model of the world that included an inherent hierarchy of kith.

Apart from doing her own experiments she has a keen interest in unlocking the secrets of luminous adra and its ability to store souls. Following the Watcher out to sea is a good way to ensure that can happen.\n\n## =Soul\n\n=\nShortly after her recruitment, the Watcher can discover exactly how intense her focus on animancy is: Ydwin performed a successful experiment and removed her soul from [the Wheel](/theWheel/) - becoming, effectively, a [fampyr](/fampyr/).

Ydwin will reply, \"I assure you, sir, that I will be admitting no part of you into my mouth. Ever.\"\n\n## Trivia\n\n* According to [Modwyr](/modwyr/), Ydwin sings \"Wending epics\" when she thinks no one is listening, which Modwyr thinks would almost be nice, except Ydwin apparently has a \"terrible singing voice\".\n* A fan favorite, Ydwin would have been a fully-featured companion if the highest funding level was reached during the Fig crowdfunding campaign.
