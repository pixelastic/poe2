Bedridden, Rinco's asked me to retrieve the money Mokeha stole, in exchange for a portion of the winnings. \n\nRinco suggested I could find Mokeha in the Huana village to the northwest of Port Maje.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* While finding Mokeha can feel like a priority, the best way is to do a little digging. Head over to [The Kraken's Eye](/theKrakensEye/) and talk to [Thorel](/thorel/) to learn that he was actually playing cards against Mokeha, apparently looking for an easy victory and \"looked real nervous\" by the end of the game. Perhaps he wasn't expecting one of the Huana to know the game so well?\n\n* Head over to [SƒÅtahuzi](/satahuzi/) and talk to [Mokeha](/mokeha/). When questioned about what happened, the Mataru will explain that she simply won a game of cards and the Vailian tried to get out of paying his dues by calling her a cheat, so she pummeled him senselessly in retaliation. At this point you have several options:\n** Point out that she was branded a thief, which she will balk at, then use [Intellect](/intellect/) 12 to point out that this is how Vailian law operates and compare that to Huana customs.\n** With a hidden culture [Deadfire Archipelago](/deadfireArchipelago/) or [Insight](/insight/) 2 - point out that Rinco is just a merchant and can't fight her on equal footing. She will consider this and realize this is like her fighting a Kuaru - improper. Eder likes this [traditional](/traditional/) approach, though Aloth does not.\n*** [Insight](/insight/) 2 - this option is only available after pointing out she was branded a thief.\n** Point out that without the coin he will lose his home.\n*** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 1 or [Intellect](/intellect/) 11 - explain that Vailians have to pay for their food and pay taxes, while Huana don't.\n*** As a [Priest of Skaen](/priestOfSkaen/), say that you've devoted your life to fighting the injustice that is the poor suffering at the hands of the wealthy. ([Passionate](/passionate/)) {{topic|Impassioned}}\n*** Explain that he has a child to feed. ([Benevolent](/benevolent/))\n*** Explain that he has a lengthy recovery period in front of him, which fail to convince her.\n** Say that Rinco got what he deserved ([Passionate](/passionate/)), and let her keep the money. Mokeha is surprised that you're taking her side and though she herself doesn't have much use for the coin, thinks that perhaps Ikawha could make use of it. This ends the quest.\n** Say that you don't care who started it, and attack Mokeha, saying you will challenge her on Rinco's behalf, she likes this, however it seems the whole town becomes hostile. You can also warn her with [Intimidate](/intimidate/) 1 as one of the first dialogue options.\n** Assassinate her in her sleep. She will put up a fight of course, but unlike outside, there's no one helping her. This angers the [chieftain](/stormSpeakerIkawha/) and depend on your excuse, she will either chase you out or attack you.\n** Pickpocket the [pouch](/rincosCoinPurse/) from Mokeha (easiest at night, in her home). Before patch 3.1.0 this even worked after you'd convinced her to hand it over peacefully. You ended up with two pouches in your inventory, although taking money from the two pouches only gave you one pouch worth. However, finishing the quest first used up one pouch, leaving you the other pouch to loot later. After patch 3.1.0 there is only one pouch to go around, if you already have it you can't see it on Mokeha anymore when you pickpocket her.\n** Go to the [chieftain](/stormSpeakerIkawha/) and ask her to tell Mokeha to turn herself in and face justice.\n*** [Resolve](/resolve/) 14 - it's either that or wait for the Vailian mob to come kill her.\n*** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 3 - she needs to do what's best for her village, not just one woman.\n*** [Bluff](/bluff/) 3 - promise that she will get a fair trial ([Shady](/shady/)).\n*** If you have previously asked she chieftain why she does business with the Vailians, you can say that she has come to rely on the Vailian traders for supplies that the village cannot produce.\n** Go to [Eofania](/eofania/) and ask her for a [shark figure](/huanaCarving/) to trade with Mokeha. This option is only available if you have previously spoken with Mokeha and meet one of the following (hidden) criteria.\n*** Have spoken to the chieftain. After saying \"She lives in your village. She's your responsibility\", she suggests that \"...if you want something from Mokeha, you should trade for it.\"\n*** [Intellect](/intellect/) 12, [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 2, or [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 2.\n\n* If you convince her peacefully to give up the pouch, she will also ask the chieftain to send a healer to fix him up.\n* Once you got the money:\n** Return to Rinco with the money.\n** Of course, you can always use [Intimidate](/intimidate/) 2 to force Rinco to confess to Darmo and pocket the money.\n** Ignore Rinco and pocket the money. Similar to enchanting items, there's a '''\"Take Money\"''' button on the description page of the pouch. This gives you {{cp2|2000}}, [Rinco's Earring](/rincosEarring/) (worth {{cp2|300}}), and an [empty purse](/rincosEmptyCoinPurse/). The empty purse can be discarded the same way you took the money or be returned to Rinco:\n*** Joke around by giving him an empty purse ([Deceptive](/deceptive/)).\n*** Give him {{cp2|1000}}, he'll be satisfied with it.\n*** Give him {{cp2|100}}, he'll accuse you of robbing him, but can't do anything further.\n\n* If you decided to let Mokeha keep the money, you can return to Rinco for some added dialogue.\n** Give him {{cp2|200}} to assist him, only if he drops the charges ([Benevolent](/benevolent/)).\n** Tell him if \"you can't defend what you have, you don't deserve it.\" ([Aggressive](/aggressive/)).\n** Say that he lied, and that the money is hers by right ([Passionate](/passionate/)).\n** Or simply say that you don't like him.\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you managed to have Mokeha return the money, Mokeha specifically says she will not apologize to Rinco. And yet the option to return the money states, \"Here. Mokeha apologized, and returned your money.\"\n* If you convinced Mokeha to turn herself in, she will be seen tied to a post in the town square of Port Maje Harbor, presumably as punishment.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/09_Port_Maje/09_TSK_Culture_Clash.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Burning Bridges'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Tensions are running high between the <b>Huana tribe</b> and the <b>Vailian settlers</b> of <b>Port Maje</b> in the wake of the storm.
