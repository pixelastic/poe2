Trees stand sentinel overlooking the sheer stone plunge into the Deadfire Sea. To the north lies a large open field ringed with woods and peppered with small clumps of dense forest. Clouds of insects hum over the rotting remnants of discarded carcasses.\n\n## Points of interest\n\n* Before you enter the lowveld, you are treated to a scripted interaction, allowing you to explore the situation. With Survival 10, you can tell apart the tracks surrounding the carcasses, allowing you to track both beast and kith. Survival 13 and 12 respectively allows you to figure out the tracks were left by a large stelgaer and four kith it was stalking. With Survival 13, you can track the kith tracks over to a scene of rather unpleasant carnage. Examining it yields a moderate amount of loot. Then you can choose to follow either the wounded kith's or the unwounded kith's tracks - or try and commune with the souls. \n*Tracking the unwounded kith reveals he has fallen of a cliff & died. You can search his corpse for valuables then you have the option to follow the wounded one.\n* Tracking the wounded kith leads to a dying dwarf clutching a small sack in his hand. After examining his wounds, you can either put him out of his misery, heal him (benevolent), hurt him (cruel), or set up a trap. He's too far gone to be healed, so it's a matter of time before the predator returns. You can set up a trap by using magical abilities, use Mechanics for traps (13 allows for setting up a burning ground one and hide it).\n* If you return to find the beast, you will hear rustiling with Perception 14 and will require Insight 13 to figure out what it means. Fleeing the beasts is possible with Athletics 9 (any character who doesn't meet that requirement will be at risk of injury). Finally, you will need to either confront the enemies or use Sleight of Hand 15 to give them the slip. Failing causes another wound - and you will fight the Great Stelgaer, accompanied by a several other kitties. \n*The defeated stelgaer drops the [cindershard](/cindershard/). Immediately after collecting it, [Whehami](/whehami/) appears.\n\n## Characters\n\n* [Whehami](/whehami/): A facet of the slayer.\n\n## Loot\n\n* [Cindershard](/cindershard/): Dropped by the great stelgaer.",
