Each stack has the following effects:\n* +6.0 sec duration of Forbidden Curse (increases with [Intellect](/intellect/) and [Power Level](/powerLevels/), decreases with [Resolve](/resolve/))\n*: Each effect in the stack is tracked separately and has its own duration and timer. For all intents and purposes, only one timer - the latest - is decremented at a time. When a new effect is added to the stack, the timer on the previous effect is paused. When the timer reaches zero, the new effect is removed and the timer of the previous effect is resumed where it left off. <p>How the duration is calculated and applied is a bit strange and in cases inconsistent. The duration of the new effect being added to the stack in the current cast is calculated with the <code>timer + 6</code>. The timer of the previous effect in the stack is paused, and its duration is adjusted to be the <code>timer - 6</code> (prior to the previous calculation, and not including the first effect). Negative adjusted durations are treated as absolute (made positive). All durations are clamped to a maximum value of 12, but keep in mind that this causes the in-game timer to be off by the difference (so if the timer shows > 12, it's likely that it spans over two or more effects in the stack). This also has a knock-on effect, and in cases where this difference between 12 and the clamped value is less than the adjusted duration of the previous effect, the previous effect will use that duration.</p>\n* +50% damage with Forbidden Fist attacks\n*: Applied to base damage (i.e. 3 stacks would provide +150% on 14-19 damage, resulting in 35-47.5 damage). This damage also applies to the curse's self damage-over-time.\n* +1 [Wound](/wound/) cost of Forbidden Fist ability.\n* 1 [Raw Damage](/rawDamage/) per 3.0 sec (to self for duration of stack)\n*: This damage is also increased by the damage bonus above, and in addition scales with the Monk's level, adding +1 damage every 3 character levels.\n\nIt should also be noted that the effects of the curse stack for the current cast are calculated and applied after the ability is cast, but before the damage is applied to the target (and self), meaning the first attack will cost 0 Wounds, but will gain +50% damage.\n\nForbidden Curse stacks are one of the main ways [Forbidden Fist](/forbiddenFist/) monks can gain [Wounds](/wounds/). When a hostile effect expires on the monk (i.e. a Forbidden Curse stack), they gain one Wound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:20px\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Stack size\n! colspan=\"4\" | Cumulative effects\n|-\n!
