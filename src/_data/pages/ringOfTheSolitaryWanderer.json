He was a solitary man and preferred to work alone whenever possible. His compatriots rarely objected. Few of them could stomach Malloy's presence for any prolonged period. To anyone present he was a crude, cruel, and generally unlikeable soul, even by the brutal standards of the Bleak Walkers.\n\nMalloy spoke at length of the countless foes he had bested, great beasts felled, and those he had crushed under his boot. If he was to be believed, the gods themselves trembled at his name. While few, if any, believed his rambling tales, none could deny that the orlan was a hardy bastard and had survived on his own through many lesser conflicts.\n\nAfter retiring, Malloy settled in the Dyrwood and lived a quiet, comfortable life. His many rivals and enemies, however, had not forgotten him. A few brief weeks into retirement, his body was discovered in his washroom. His neighbors, hardly surprised, testified to the bailiff that Malloy must have accidently cut off his own head while shaving. Nothing had been stolen, save for his ring.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Fingers\n| item_type      = Ring\n| item_category  = Accessory\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 410\n| shop_value     = 2050\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = Self-Motivated;Lone Wolf \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Ring_U_Ring_Of_The_Solitary_Wanderer\n| location       = * Looted from [Bounty - Pūrākau](/bountyPurakau/), located at 26° 58' S, 45° 9' E. \n| guid           = 6f080ca8-f791-49db-998c-7a8875b38a56\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Ring}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n##  Description \n\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n##  Acquisition \n\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
