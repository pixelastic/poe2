  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsSeekerSlayerSurvivor/) in {{lax1}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nBy completing the challenges presented by one of the Faces, the Watcher has earned the right to represent one of the Faces of the Hunt in the Crucible's bloodiest battle. If they prove victorious, they will be named Champion of the Hunt - and become able to commune with the Faces of the Hunt themselves\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This is the penultimate challenge in the DLC, where you face off with two other packs in a free for all battle. Each of the packs represents a Face. After defeating them all, you will be permitted to commune with the Faces through the Pool of Memories.\n** Tips for the battle go here!\n*Once you commune with the Faces, you are drawn into [the Beyond](/theBeyond/). In there, you will find the answers to the crisis plaguing Kazuwari, once again encountering all three souls first met during [the Crucible](/theCrucible/):\n**[Erūke](/eruke/) the kith soul behind the Surviving Face, will reveal that [Whehami](/whehami/), the Slaying Face, severed the island's connection to the Beyond. Erūke wants this bond restored.\n** [Aexica](/aexica/), the kith soul behind the Seeking Face, wants you to defeat Whehami and restore the island's connection to the Beyond as well, but for reasons of her own.\n** [Whehami](/whehami/), on the other hand is holding Galawain's realm hostage, severed from the rest of the Beyond. He wants another soul - yours - to take the place of the Faces of the Hunt so that he may walk again in the flesh.\n* Though centuries separated their lives from one another, Aexica, Erūke, and Whehami became the Faces of the Hunt at the same time. By interrogating the souls, you can learn that the three actually share a single soul. Some clever deduction on the Watcher's part will also reveal that Aexica provided Whehami with the knowledge he needed to sever Kazuwari's ties to the Beyond and that she manipulated Whehami into clogging the flow of souls between Kazuwari and the Beyond for her own ends.\n* The decision in this quest affects the ending for Kazuwari:\n** You can defeat Whehami in combat. Aexica will then attack you, and you will have to defeat her as well.\n**With Intimidate 22 and high Aggressive (unconfirmed) or Stoic reputation, you can convince Whehami to continue serving the Crucible as the Slaying Face and he will allow you to restore the flow of souls and leave.\n***If you chose to become the Slayer's champion during [The Crucible](/theCrucible/) by completing [The Slaying Face (quest)](/theSlayingFaceQuest/), you have an intimidate 16 option, as well.\n**You can convince Whehami to switch his soul with someone else's. After speaking to Whehami about his plan, return to Aexica and ask her if it will work. This will unlock the option to propose a swap to Whehami. There are three possible trades: \n*** You can sacrifice [Konstanten](/konstanten/)'s soul, to his and the rest of the party's dismay.\n***If you funneled soul energy into Muatu during your fights in the Crucible, you can offer him as a replacement. The rest of the party disapproves of this, as well..\n*** If you chose to become the Slayer's champion during [The Crucible](/theCrucible/) by completing [The Slaying Face (quest)](/theSlayingFaceQuest/) (and received [Slayer's Claw](/slayersClaw/) as your reward), you can convince Whehami that you will help him replace his soul with that of Galawain's beast in [The Hunter Hunted](/theHunterHunted/). \n**If you chose to become the Seeker's champion during [The Crucible](/theCrucible/) by completing [The Seeking Face (quest)](/theSeekingFaceQuest/) and have some very high skills, you can expose Aexica's manipulation of Whehami and either kill her or convince them to stand down. There are three parts to this:\n***Discover that Aexica, Whehami, and Eruke are all the same soul by uncovering three pieces of evidence:\n****The first time you speak with Aexica, you '''MUST''' select the dialogue option asking if Whehami is the first to attempt to escape Toamowhai's realm (\"Have others left their posting here, or is Whehami's attempt the first?\") to make Aexica reveal that the three Faces have always been together. The option does not reappear in later conversations, and there is no way to get this information from her otherwise.\n****Speak with Whehami and ask him about the memory you saw when approaching him to make him reveal that he was awakened to the past lives of his soul as fighters in the Crucible.\n****Speak with Eruke about how many spirits are present in Toamowhai's realm, and whether there were other Faces before the current three.\n****After gathering all three pieces, speak to Eruke again with Metaphysics 12. Then, return to Aexica and inform her that the three are a single soul warring against itself and that they should stop fighting. Failing to complete this stage will prevent a completely peaceful solution.\n***Discover Aexica's desire to escape and her manipulation of Whehami to that end:\n****You can uncover Aexica's unrest with Insight 17 during your first conversation with her by asking if Whehami is the first to attempt to escape Toamowhai's realm, or with Insight 18 after speaking with Whehami by telling her Whehami's plan and asking if it will work.\n****Then, speak with Whehami and ask him directly about Aexica's wish to leave. He will not believe you, but will tell you about the [Tooth of Toamowhai](/toothOfToamowhai/).\n****Return to Aexica and confront her about manipulating Whehami. She will deny it, but as her champion, you can request the truth. This is the only way to make her confess her plan.\n***Convince Aexica to abandon her scheme, or reveal her manipulations to Whehami: \n****After informing Aexica that you are aware she shares a soul with the other Faces and getting her to confess her manipulations, ask her to explain exactly how she was planning to escape. After her explanation (and some party banter), you will have a Diplomacy 20 option to convince her to abandon her scheme and set things right. Then return to Whehami and tell him that Aexica has admitted to manipulating him and wants to set things right. He will allow you to repair the flow of souls and leave.\n****Alternately, if you can't muster 20(!) Diplomacy or can't complete the discovery of the Faces' shared soul, you can go to Whehami after extracting Aexica's confession and tell him that she has admitted to manipulating him. He be angry and demand you kill Aexica, after which he will allow you to repair the flow of souls and leave.\n** If you chose to become the Survivor's champion during [The Crucible](/theCrucible/) by completing [The Surviving Face (quest)](/theSurvivingFaceQuest/), you can convince Whehami to stand down with Eruke's aid.\n***Discover that Aexica, Whehami, and Eruke are all the same soul via the same steps as above. You do not need to pass either Insight check with Aexica, but you do need to ask her if Whehami's escape attempt is the first of its kind during your initial conversation with her, and pass the Metaphysics 12 check with Eruke. Eruke will tell you to speak with Whehami.\n***Speak with Whehami about his shared soul with the other Faces. There appears to be some bugged dialogue here--you have to exhaust all three options to get through to him, but his reaction or any intended intervention by Eruke is missing. However, he will concede and let you repair the flow of souls and leave peacefully.\n**You can agree to Whehami's plan and replace him as the Slaying Face. In that case, after your companions make sure that you understand the consequences, your game ends there and you will see the ending slides (see below).\n* All steps finally require you to restore the flow of souls using the [Tooth of Toamowhai](/toothOfToamowhai/).\n\n## Gallery\n\n###### Ending slides if you allow Whehami to take your body, replacing him as the Slaying Face:\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Deadfire Ending SSS Give Up 1.jpg\nFile:Deadfire Ending SSS Give Up 2.jpg\nFile:Deadfire Ending SSS Give Up 3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX01_00_Arena_Island/LAX01_00_qst_main_quest_04.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Champion of the Hunt'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| I have earned the right to represent one of the Faces of the Hunt in the Crucible's bloodiest battle.
