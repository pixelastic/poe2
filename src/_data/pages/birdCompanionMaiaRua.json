This connection allows rangers and their companions to coordinate attacks and efficiently take down prey. In most situations, the companion runs interference while the ranger attacks at range.\n\nDespite these advantages, there are risks to the relationship. Rangers share a literal life bond with their animal companions. When one is wounded, the can sense it and feel intense emotional pain. If a ranger or animal companion are knocked unconscious, the partner suffers from Bonded Grief, affecting Accuracy and other stats, until the downed ally is revived. If a ranger is ever killed, the animal companion immediately dies from grief.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| class          = Ranger\n| subclass       = Gunhawk\n| race           = \n| subrace        = \n| activation     = Passive\n| activation_req = \n| combat_only    = no\n| ability_type   = Ability\n| ability_level  = 0\n| ability_origin = Character\n| modal_group    = \n| learn_type     = Automatic\n| learn_level    = 0\n| learn_level_mc = 0\n| learn_req      = [[Maia Rua]] only\n| upgrades_from  = \n| upgrades_to    = \n| keywords       = \n| counters       = \n| source         = \n| source_cost    = \n| uses           = \n| restoration    = \n| cast_time      = \n| recovery_time  = \n| range          = \n| area_of_effect = \n| duration       = \n| linger         = \n| noise_use      = \n| noise_impact   = \n| target         = Summon\n| effects        = Ishiza\n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_abilities  = Gunhawk (passive)\n| rel_items      = \n| rel_characters = \n| internalname   = Summon_Companion_Maia_Bird\n| guid           = 268deb28-224e-4d21-a825-8808f1f4e55a\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is an [[Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire abilities|ability]] in {{poe2}}.\n\n==Description==\n{{Description|{{#var:description}}}}\n\n==Effects==\n{{#var:effects_formatted}}\n\n==Notes==\n* Unique to the [[Gunhawk]] [[Ranger]] subclass ([[Maia]])",
