What little knowledge still remains of her says that she was a skilled engineer. It should be fascinating to see if any of her work was buried with her. 10 Majestu - Damn. I should've known better. Just getting here was bad enough, but it looks as though her burial site was crafted to make sure no one disturbs her. I've already lost three of my companions, and another other took off in the night. Scared off, I guess. I'm on my own. Paira was good, if she designed these traps... but no one would build something like this without a backdoor, or a way to turn them off. I'll just keep looking. 11 Majestu - Something from an old story came back to me during the night, \"shaking hands with the gods\". Well, there are no gods in here, just a room filled with some kind of noxious gas. 12 Majestu - Scrap of parchment, crumbled away in my hands. Was barely able to make out a single sentence, \"Rikuhu is the beginning. Rikuhu is the end.\"\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Journal\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_UCI_8_Explorers_Journal\n| location       = \n| guid           =b64e47e6-0d7e-4c36-941c-bd7148630956\n\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Journal }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
