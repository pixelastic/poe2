However, Thorel, the tavernkeeper, is willing to put the Watcher up - if they clear out one of the current occupants. Thorel identified the lead culprit as Galian, a merchant captain. You can find him and his crew upstairs, in the room furthest to the back.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Speak to [Thorel](/thorel/) in [The Kraken's Eye](/theKrakensEye/) to start the quest. Thorel is willing to let you stay if Galian, a local captain, vacates his room upstairs. He offers you a discount on the room in return. Note that asking that he pay you instead (as a [Goldpact Knights](/goldpactKnights/) paladin, or just generally) doesn't result in a change in the reward received.\n* Head up the stairs and find [Galian](/galian/) and his crew in the back room. The door is initially locked (difficulty 4), but you can open it with the [key](/krakensEyeRoomKey/) Thorel gave you.\n* You have an assortment of options to get him to clear out peacefully:\n** Threaten him with guards (minor [Rational](/rational/) disposition and a minor reaction to [Pride](/pride/) if you have [Aloth](/aloth/) or [Tekēhu](/tekehu/) in your party). When he decides to put up a fight, you can use...\n*** [Athletics](/athletics/) 2 to punch him.\n*** [Dexterity](/dexterity/) 13 to dodge his punch.\n*** [Resolve](/resolve/) 13 to stop him from getting riled up.\n*** [Constitution](/constitution/) 13 to take the punch (+4 [Stoic](/stoic/)), after which you can punch him.\n*** [Sleight of Hand](/sleightOfHand/) 2 allows you to stab him in the arm, though it does give you +4 [Cruel](/cruel/) disposition.\n*** Shove him back or ask if he feels better about himself (minor [Stoic](/stoic/) disposition), this leads to the \"polite\" options below.\n** Use [Intimidate](/intimidate/) 2 to threaten violence (minor [Aggressive](/aggressive/) disposition).\n** Try to be polite about the situation...\n*** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 2, tell him that Thorel seems pretty steamed.\n*** Give him {{cp2|100}} to find another tavern.\n*** Ask him to pay what he's owed, then suggest he ask around the docks for work.\n* Alternatively, you can start combat by saying that Thorel gave you permission to get rough if you had to (minor [Aggressive](/aggressive/) disposition). Upon being brought to zero health, Galian will concede and will agree to leave. You can choose to let him live - for a peaceful result, or finish him off. Note that this prompt does not trigger should you attack him out of conversation.\n* Once Galian and his crew have been dealt with, return to Thorel for your reward.\n** If you killed them and made a mess of the place, Thorel will be understandably angry. With 2 [Bluff](/bluff/), you can claim self defense, and as a [Goldpact Knights](/goldpactKnights/) paladin, you can be apologetic. Regardless of the dialogue options you choose, there's no undoing the damage.\n\n## Note\n\n* When you first speak to Thorel, if you ask him to pay you money instead of giving you a discount, he will promise you a reward in addition. This however does not change the reward received, as he implies.\n* Starting combat with Galian through dialogue will only cause Galian and Baru to attack, while attacking them outside of dialogue will cause the entire crew to attack.\n* The dialogue option to threaten Galian with guards is repeatable, and so are the disposition and reputation modifiers behind it. This allows you to infinitely add 1 point to your [Rational](/rational/) disposition, as well as a Minor (4) adjustment to your companion relationships ([Pride](/pride/)), -16 with [Aloth](/aloth/) and +32 with [Tekēhu](/tekehu/) each time.\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n* Another rather hilarious dialog option in the \"polite\" route exists, though it is disabled (perhaps it didn't work thematically due to the reliance on a non-existent voice for the Watcher). It requires [Intellect](/intellect/) 11 and [Insight](/insight/) 2, and grants the player minor [Clever](/clever/) disposition. The conversation still has VO, and can be re-enabled by modifying or removing the \"AlwaysFalse\" condition in <code>09_cv_galain.conversationbundle</code>, node 31.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:20px\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | Watcher\n| <i>\"I thought I'd help out with your headache.
