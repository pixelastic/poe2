Locating a sample of starmetal will enable her to scribe a unique spell, and she promises to share the results of her research with the watcher. She is certain that a celestial catalyst - a piece of charged starmetal - can be found somewhere in the Halls Obscured. A falling star struck this location recently, so the Watcher may have to look deeper.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Deeper is an understatement. The quest will not be possible to complete until the player reaches [The Upper Bowels](/theUpperBowels/). The starmetal can be obtained at the Celestial Remnant near the massive piece of Wael.\n* To avoid a fight, the souls in the starmetal must first be calmed. There's two ways of doing this:\n** Sacrificing the pet [Giftwrapper](/giftwrapper/).\n** Or by having read the book [On Celestial Spectres: Visitors from Farther than Beyond](/onCelestialSpectresVisitorsFromFartherThanBeyond/) and passing two Metaphysics checks:\n*** '''Metaphysics 15''': ''If you allow the spirits to commune with your soul, ig might prove a suitable distraction to claim a piece of the metal for yourself.''\n*** Metaphysics: ''Try and commune with the spirits.''\n*** '''Metaphysics 20''': ''You open a metaphysical bridge between your soul and the entities inhabiting the mineral.''\n*** The spirits will understand what your intention is, and aren't really bothered when they see that you're not hostile to them. They will let you snap of a piece of metal without incident.\n* Collecting the [Fragment of Starmetal](/fragmentOfStarmetal/) without doing either will cause Celestial Spectres to attack.\n* Once they are gone, it's a simple matter of returning to Bekarna to receive her grimoire and a unique tool, the [Celestial Agitator](/celestialAgitator/), that allows for spawning star spirits.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX03_Forgotten_Sanctum/lax03_tsk_04_celestial_magic_03.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Out of Eternal Horizons'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Now that <b>Bekarna</b> has her grimoire back, she remembers why she came to the Black Isles in the first place - to recover a fallen star.
