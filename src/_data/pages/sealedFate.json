He asks that you retrieve [Degnos' Satchel](/degnosSatchel/) from the second floor of the [Luminous Bathhouse](/luminousBathhouse/). Degnos urges you not to open the satchel.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* After agreeing to help Degnos, you may enter the [Luminous Bathhouse](/luminousBathhouse/) where you will find [Degnos' Satchel](/degnosSatchel/) in a wardrobe on the second floor.\n* If you choose to open Degnos' Satchel you will find [Avetta's Seal](/avettasSeal/) and a letter detailing a plan to sabotage the ship of Degnos' captain, [Avetta](/avetta/), so that Degnos can join the crew of a Príncipi captain, [Talfor](/talfor/). The knowledge of the contents of the satchel allows you to report Degnos' betrayal to Avetta, convince Degnos to not carry through with the plan, or return the satchel's contents with the assurance that you will not interfere.\n* You will encounter Talfor and his crew en route back to [Queen's Berth](/queensBerth/) to decide what to do with Degnos and Avetta.\n** Depending on your interaction with Talfor, you may proceed to Queen's Berth peacefully, although Talfor will insist that and he and his thugs \"escort\" you along the way. Refusing this will result in combat.\n** You may also choose to ignore him and walk away, only to result in him grabbing you and preventing you from leaving. You may punch him which will result in combat.\n** You may kill Talfor in order to prevent the sabotage of Avetta's ship. Additionally, if you fight him, it will result in Minor Negative Reputation lost with the Principi for every one of his thugs you kill.\n* Note that the above and reputation loss can be avoided by traveling to Queen's Berth from the Undercroft by boat and avoiding the streets of Neketaka to Queen's Berth.\n* Degnos is relieved and grateful if you choose not to interfere with his plan and return the satchel along with its contents. He gives you {{cp2|37}} and promises to repay you properly at some point down the line. Grateful that you returned [Degnos' Satchel](/degnosSatchel/) and its contents to him, you may convince Degnos to abandon his plot to kill Avetta.\n* Otherwise, revealing Degnos' betrayal to Avetta results in Degnos fleeing the area. Avetta awards you with {{cp2|1087}} and a minor positive increase in reputation with the [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/). You can later find Degnos near the Temple Ruins in the [Old City](/oldCity/) Overlook section of the [Neketaka](/neketaka/) undercity.\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n* The character portrait for [Talfor](/talfor/) bears a striking resemblance to [Josh Sawyer](/joshSawyer/), the Game Director of ''[Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfire/).''<ref>https://twitter.com/jesawyer/status/994717527614799872</ref>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/05_Neketaka_Artisans_District/05_TSK_Sealed_Fate.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Sealed Fate'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| I found <b>Degnos</b> outside of the <b>Luminous Bathhouse</b> lamenting the loss of his satchel.
