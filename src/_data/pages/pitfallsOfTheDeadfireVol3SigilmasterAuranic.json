One passage stands out:\n\n\"Sigilmaster Auranic is ON THE LOOSE. She was sentenced for planting DEADLY sigils in populated areas, and affected her escape with nothing more than a stone game piece and an inkwell. \n\nTrust in the authorities and make NO ATTEMPT to apprehend her. She will have flanked herself in sigils powerful enough to EXPLODE unwary visitors on the spot.\n\nThe Deadfire Visitor's Preservation Society takes no responsibility for harm inflicted by knowing ignorance of the risks, and every effort has been made to keep travelers AWAY from the following coordinates: 4° 50' S 67° 31' E.\" \n\nA map of Auranic's position is marked off with a wax seal in the shape of a skull. It points toward an underwater cave far to the northeast.\n| added_in       = laxg1\n| added_in_cat   = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Book\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 16\n| shop_value     = 80\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 1 - The Crystal Empress;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 2 - The Voracious Mountain;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 3 - Sigilmaster Auranic;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 4 - The Helfire Colossus\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = MISC_Mega_Boss_Chronicles_Volume_3\n| location       = * [[Queen's Berth]]: Sold by [[Sanza]] of [[Sanza's Map Emporium]].\n| guid           = e827efc1-f673-4614-a409-0dc0a60450b8\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [[book]] in {{poe2}}.\n\nIt was added in {{laxf3}}, and warns readers of the perils of [[Sigilmaster Auranic]] - conveniently providing her exact location.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
