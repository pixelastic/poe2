Serafen doesn't believe that Remaro, a pirate hunted by the Príncipi for mutiny, could have committed the treachery they accuse him of. He asked me to help search Fort Deadlight for information about Remaro's current whereabouts.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nSerafen will automatically talk to you as you arrive at [Fort Deadlight](/fortDeadlight/) and ask you to find Remaro, starting the quest.\n* Go to [Deadlight Court](/deadlightCourt/), in the northeastern part of the area. Serafen will automatically speak up once you're near Remaro's chest and rummage through it. You will find out that Remaro supposedly met someone named [Udyne](/udyne/) in Neketaka.\n* Head to the [Luminous Bathhouse](/luminousBathhouse/). Udyne will claim Remaro intends to resupply at [Sayuka](/sayuka/) before leaving the Deadfire after you persuade her. Serafen wants you to follow in search of the old pirate.\n* [Malnaj](/malnaj/) will accost you on the streets and you can reveal Udyne's involvement or stay silent. \n* Continue to [Sayuka](/sayuka/). Talk to Remaro, found at the top of the stairs that are west of the Fleet Master's Office. You can choose to either let Remaro go, or turn him in for the bounty. How you handle the conversation will affect Serafen's [end-game slides](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireEndingsSerafen/).\n** In order to expose that Remaro and Serafen's former captain - Bastian of The Sorcerer - had been selling the slaves they rescued, you need to have learned that the Príncipi work with slavers. This requires having at least started [Of Like Minds](/ofLikeMinds/) or [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/). This will reveal the true reason that Remaro left the Príncipi, giving Serafen closure.\n** If you're intent on bringing Remaro in, he'll kindly refuse, leaving you with no other choice but to use force. Serafen warns you that he'll be forced to take Remaro's side, should you do so. If you didn't uncover the slaver operation (giving Remaro an understandable reason for doing what he did), you can convince Serafen to back down by reminding him that in the Príncipi - mutiny means death, or with Streetwise 7 / Intimidate 5. Otherwise, after learning the true reason behind Remaro's mutiny, Serafen will be bewildered that you would attack a man who refused to work under a slaver operation, and will attack you upon entering combat. Either way Serafen will be removed from the party. Note that the quest will fail upon his death, although this doesn't affect the reward. At this point, remember: The Príncipi placed a bounty on Remaro and should pay for [proof](/remarosHead/) of his demise.\n** Alternatively, you can kill Remaro without Serafen in the party and still turn in the bounty and finish the quest. However, this will be reflected in his end-game slides as if you had not completed his quest.\n** If you let Remaro go, he will give you the unique blunderbuss [Fire in the Hole](/fireInTheHole/), thanking you for your understanding.\n* Upon leaving Sayuka, [Malnaj](/malnaj/) and her crew are waiting for you in their ship ''[Misery's Delight](/miserysDelight/)'', asking you what your excuse is for being in the place they tracked Remaro to.\n** If you spared Remaro (or haven't yet dealt with him), you can lie about killing him, and then pay her {{cp2|2000}} (with [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 5 + [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 8) to leave you be, which will net you Minor Positive reputation with the Príncipi. If you have Serafen in your party she won't believe you and attack you.\n** If you killed Remaro, you can also choose to hand over the bounty, netting you Moderate Positive reputation with the Príncipi, and ending the quest.\n** If you haven't yet dealt with Remaro, you can lie and say you heard some dockhands saw him depart for Nekataka. If you succeed (with [Bluff](/bluff/) 8), she'll thank you for the information and will give you a 10% cut of the bounty ({{cp2|400}}), though she warns you that she'll be back if it turns out you lied. If you fail, or if you have Serafen in your party, she won't be fooled and will attack.\n** With [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 13 / [Intimidate](/intimidate/) 10 you can tell her to stop testing you, since you work for the council, and she will leave you alone.\n** Otherwise, if you choose not to cave to their demands, a fight will ensue. Note that killing the Príncipi sailors does not affect your reputation.\n* If you killed Remaro, and still have his head, take it to [Udita](/udita/), in [Dunnage](/dunnage/), [Lifter's Refuge](/liftersRefuge/) for a cool {{cp2|4000}}.\n\n## Trivia\n\n* If you successfully lie to Malnaj regarding the wherabouts of Remaro (pointing her in the direction of Neketaka), after five in-game days you will recieve an [Unsigned Missive](/unsignedMissive/) - her attempt to lure you in for revenge. The missive directs you towards a \"Call for help\" on the same island as [Oathbinder's Sanctum](/oathbindersSanctum/), southwest of [Neketaka](/neketaka/). Naturally Malnaj and her crew are waiting for you there.\n\n## Gallery\n\n###### Upon leaving [Sayuka](/sayuka/)\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\n SD dhow.png\n RE si ship parley 01.png\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/Companions/companion_qst_serafen.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''A Sorcerer and a Gentleman'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Serafen</b> wants me to help him track down an old pirate named <b>Remaro</b>.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Help <b>Serafen</b> uncover information on <b>Remaro</b> at <b>Fort Deadlight</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| <b>Serafen</b> doesn't believe that <b>Remaro</b>, a pirate hunted by the Príncipi for mutiny, could have committed the treachery they accuse him of.
