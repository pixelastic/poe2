I was in my study, trying to pack up important documents for the evacuation, never dreaming the Aedyrans would act so drastically. It was my wife, Ne'iloc who first heard the cracking of the levies. We climbed to the roof, when the water reached the top of the stairs. My three children, Nathe, Leibelsa, and Kyrre, we held. The water reached our chests, and the only thing that kept us from getting swept away before it subsided was holding onto the chimney, that we had just repaired. Other families were not so lucky.\n\nWhen the waters finally subsided, the roads were littered with debris, mud, and rotting fish. Half the district had been swallowed by the sea. Bodies floated in the tide along with what was left in the homes. We burned the citizens we found. The poor souls have nobody else to remember them by, so I'll document them here. I'm not sure if they had loved ones who survived the flood, but it is better their names be written down rather than washed away with so much else in this horrific flood.\"\n\nWilliam \"Bloody Bill\" Thistlewood - Butcher<br/>\nAlbel Nordenbring - Professor<br/>\nRaedwulf - Spearman<br/>\nStar Halfyur The Devoted - Priest<br/>\nKilrath Crimsonblade - Swordmaster<br/>\nJohn Graham - City Garrison<br/>\nKrotok - Prize Hunter<br/>\nValheru - Archivist<br/>\nEdvar Solinarous - Poet<br/>\nMagistrum - Tactician<br/>\nClaude Nothalis - Teacher<br/>\nIryk Launavan - Astronomer<br/>\nJaeryth - Archer<br/>\nDeathok - Undertaker<br/>\nDedaug - Fisherman<br/>\nXan Tidi - Monk<br/>\nAlvir - Herbalist<br/>\nJorde Lenn - Tanner<br/>\nKhanthrok Conlon - Alchemist<br/>\nZtordan - Mage<br/>\nGavinius - Knight<br/>\nGalorian Dragonheart - Politician<br/>\nAryana Gemstar - Appraiser<br/>\nVigoro - Artist<br/>\nKaelin Hallowed - Assassin<br/>\nLaurin Pollacus - Physician<br/>\nMinneus Maranus - Duelist<br/>\nAmanthor - Bodyguard<br/>\nDragicus - Trader<br/>\nFenrir - Protector of the Order<br/>\nKron - Sellsword<br/>\nO'Beronn - Smith<br/>\nMarzagal - Barrister<br/>\nAeron Coal - Miner<br/>\nYreth - Infantry<br/>\nLilith - Lighthouse Keeper\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Book\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 16\n| shop_value     = 80\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Lore_Book_Backer_Flood_Memorial\n| location       = \n| guid           = a96de79b-2fa1-47c7-b050-2814b700cffa\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [[book]] in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This book memorializes a number of the citizens lost in a flood of [[Ondra's Gift]] in {{poe1}}.
