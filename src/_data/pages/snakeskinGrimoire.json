  "raw": "{{Infobox item poe2\n| name           = Snakeskin Grimoire\n| icon           = poe2 grimoire07 icon.png\n| description    = A grimoire is the lifeblood of any wizard's magical repertoire. These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.\n\nIt is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.\n\nThough all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 760\n| shop_value     = 3800\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Jolting Touch (Deadfire);Fleet Feet (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Fetid Caress (Deadfire);Merciless Gaze (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Noxious Burst (Deadfire);Arduous Delay of Motion (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Nannasin's Cobra Strike;Ironskin (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Ryngrim's Enervating Terror (Deadfire);Malignant Cloud (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire);Death Ring (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Citzal's Martial Power (Deadfire);Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Caedebald's Blackbow (Deadfire);Minoletta's Piercing Sigil (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Concelhaut's Corrosive Skin;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Snakeskin_Grimoire\n| location       = * [[Queen's Berth]]: Sold by [[Sanza]] of [[Sanza's Map Emporium]].\n| guid           =0c4bd378-2d45-4b92-b3f2-4403e954d0c4\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire }} in {{poe2}}\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n* Contains the unique level 4 spell [[Nannasin's Cobra Strike]].",
