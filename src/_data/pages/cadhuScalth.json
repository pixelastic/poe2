Crafted from a single slab of adra, Cadhu Scalth - \"the Saint's Protection\" - is a natural reservoir for soul energy and lent considerable power to the vessel who bore it. The saint was parted from his shield only when the volcano over which the sacred site he guarded erupted.\n\nThe shield was recovered many years later by a band of Roparu woodsmen where it was half-submerged in a quickmud pit. The Roparu, none of whom grasped the value of the find, retrieved it for curiosity's sake. The shield was no more than a novelty until it began to \"sing,\" as the woodsmen described it. They recounted to their chieftain that the dissonant melody hummed with \"luminous colors\" that revealed their lives past and shook them to their core. The chieftain, unwary of the implications of such tales, took the shield for his personal use.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Shield\n| shield_type       = Large shield\n| item_category     = Shield\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1157\n| shop_value        = 5785\n| deflection_mod    = 19\n| accuracy_mod      = -8\n| shield_bonuses    = Shield Engagement\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional shield (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Soul Strike (enchantment){{!}}Soul Strike;Heavy Shard;Luminous Dissonance\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Shield_Large_U_Cadhu_Scalth\n| location          = * [[Old City]]: Inside the Old City proper, in the hidden chamber in Ondra's temple.\n| guid              = 31167607-7bfd-417c-8dd6-d1808e4e2bb9\n}}\n[[File:Poe2 Sketch Cadu Scalth.png|290px|thumb|right|Sketch image]]\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Large shield}} in {{poe2}}.\n__NOTOC__\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Luminous Harmony and Soul Smite are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Luminous_Harmony-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|3f03c8f9-3d68-4dd5-be85-dc07f0bd9c6b}}\n|effect =Upgrades [[Luminous Dissonance]], removing the +5% Damage taken, and reducing damage taken from ''all'' sources (instead of just spells)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =501e3e97-52e1-4385-9612-5ee2788c0e2d\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =54d6e0fa-16a6-4794-b4cd-cc3e83c6fa92\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =f163ffbf-9539-4e6e-ab78-33fb5519066e\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=63d1c47c-6f0d-46fe-ac7a-f351d6c2b08e\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Soul_Smite-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|18208e9c-3cdd-43f9-8a9d-cea66d6029c7}}\n|effect =Grants [[Soul Smite]], an upgraded version of [[Soul Strike (ability)|Soul Strike]], dealing more damage, interrupting on [[Graze]], and pushing the target 3m back.\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =501e3e97-52e1-4385-9612-5ee2788c0e2d\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =54d6e0fa-16a6-4794-b4cd-cc3e83c6fa92\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =e474463c-1c74-44c5-945c-385d864b6974\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=ada8ae46-b63c-4251-9bf4-10f16cceb4b5\n}}\n}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because of the existence of a sketch image for Cadhu Scalth, it's likely that it was originally intended to be a soulbound shield.",
