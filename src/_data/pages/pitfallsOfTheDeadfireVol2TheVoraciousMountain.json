One passage stands out:\n\n\"Do NOT dispose of sick livestock by feeding them to Hauani O Whe. That PRIMORDIAL ABOMINATION has grown to the size of a mountain already thanks to misguided pilgrims worshipping it as a god.\n\nA DIRE warning - Hauani O Whe vomits forth a symbiote that injure a motionless host reproduces on a moving one. Simply AVOIDING the creature at all costs will prevent GRAVE PERIL, INFESTATION, AND PROBABLE DEATH. \n\nAs always, the Deadfire Visitor's Preservation Society takes no responsibility for harm inflicted by knowing ignorance of the risks, and every effort has been made to keep travelers AWAY from the following coordinates: 25° 52' S 34° 22' E.\" \n\nA map of Hauani O Whe's position is marked off with a wax seal in the shape of a skull. It points toward a lagoon south of Dunnage.\n| added_in       = laxf2\n| added_in_cat   = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Book\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 16\n| shop_value     = 80\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 1 - The Crystal Empress;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 2 - The Voracious Mountain;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 3 - Sigilmaster Auranic;Pitfalls of the Deadfire Vol. 4 - The Helfire Colossus\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = MISC_Mega_Boss_Chronicles_Volume_2\n| location       = * [[Queen's Berth]]: Sold by [[Sanza]] of [[Sanza's Map Emporium]].\n| guid           = fd6fa926-2ac4-4e5f-8693-8b290065a688\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a [[book]] in {{poe2}}.\n\nIt was added in {{laxf2}}, and warns readers of the perils of [[Hauani O Whe]] - conveniently providing its exact location.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
