It distracted him just in time to stop him from being blown to bits. Stranded and with no crew left, he's come to The Kraken's Eye to find a way off the island, and to forget his friends who weren't as lucky as he was.\n* You can (optionally) buy him a drink for {{cp|14}}, and listen to his story. During the dialogue there are a few ways to obtain the coin:\n** With [Insight](/insight/) 12, you can tell he isn't very happy about escaping death and the fate of his fellow crewmembers for a single coin, and that he thinks it shows cowardice. Then assure him that it's not his fault with [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 17, and say he should blame the pirates, or his captain for choosing to fight. This option is not repeatable.\n** With [Arcana](/arcana/) 18, convince him that the coin is a curse that brought death not to him, but to everyone else. He says you seem to know your curses and hexes, and gives you the coin.\n** With [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 6 you can ask to buy it from him, though he says not willing to part with it for all the coin in the world.\n** Say \"this calls for something stronger\" and buy him a bottle of [Rum](/rum/) for {{cp2|130}} (this option is repeatable, after leaving dialogue). Then you can either:\n*** Drink him under the table with a hidden [Constitution](/constitution/) 13 check.\n*** Pretend to drink with [Bluff](/bluff/) 8 and [Sleight of Hand](/sleightOfHand/) 5. This check is also available if you say \"I've come for the coin\" when first talking to him, and doing so will avoid having to pay for the rum.\n*** Poison his drink with a [Fungal Bile](/fungalBile/) ([Cruel](/cruel/)), killing him and leaving you free to take the coin.\n::If you're successful with one of the first two checks he'll fall asleep in his chair and you can then steal the coin from him ([Shady](/shady/)) or leave it be ([Honest](/honest/)). He'll continue to be asleep after you leave.\n* Or you can simply pickpocket it from him with [Sleight of Hand](/sleightOfHand/) 6. Caedric himself doesn't move, but the patrons around the tavern regularly walk within line-of-sight, making it quite a challenge without fairly high [Stealth](/stealth/).\n\n## Notes\n\n* After making him fall asleep, the dialogue options to steal or leave the coin are repeatable and give you 1 [Disposition](/disposition/) every time, a good way to \"farm\" disposition if for some reason you wanted to do so.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX01_00_Arena_Island/LAX01_00_tsk_artifact_slayer_lucky_coin.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Slaying Face's Hunt for the Luckless Coin'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| The Slaying Face wants me to retrieve a <b>cursed coin</b> and return it to the <b>Pool of Memories.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Acquire the <b>Luckless Coin.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Engari's information suggested that the coin I seek can be found at the <b>Kraken's Eye</b> in <b>Port Maje.</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''3'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Return the <b>Luckless Coin</b> to the <b>Pool of Memories.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10003\n| I have acquired the coin desired by the Slaying Face.
