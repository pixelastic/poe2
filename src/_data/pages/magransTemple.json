As of patch 5.0.0, it can no longer be accessed without downgrading to an older version of the game.\n\n## Background\n\nAn interior alternate version of the temple to [Magran](/magran/) in [The Sacred Stair](/theSacredStair/) district of [Neketaka](/neketaka/).\n\n## Points of interest\n\n###### Magran's Temple\n\n* The southwestern entrance connects to the northwestern exit in the Sacred Stair, which actually leads to [Serpent's Crown](/serpentsCrown/) on the map screen.\n* The southern entrance connects to the northeastern most exit in the Sacred Stair, however using this exit from the Sacred Stair side only serves as a shortcut between the upper and lower levels of the area, placing you by the entrance to the [Temple of Gaun](/templeOfGaun/).\n* The exit to the northeast presumably would've led to [The Champion's Hearth](/theChampionsHearth/).\n\n###### The Champion's Hearth\n\n* A large empty room, consisting of a pit-flanked hall leading to an altar, otherwise nothing of note. The exit places the party at the southern entrance to Magran's Temple, however geographically this area seems to be to the northeast, by the unnavigable exit.\n\n## Characters\n\n* [High Priest Hati](/highPriestHati/), as in the regular temple.\n* [Testacles](/testacles/), naked doorman with a unique name, and missing dialogue. He was used to debug parts of the game, and his dialogue triggers various changes to global values, quest states, player character changes, etc.\n\n## Loot\n\n* In a hidden rubble pile behind the High Priest: [Fine Pistol](/finePistolDeadfire/), [Black Pearl](/blackPearl/), 30x [Golden Oble](/currency/).\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n* This interior area is not used in game, and was likely a prototype or a planned extension of Magran's Temple as it is in the current game. You can still teleport to it using console commands however. The actual temple, called \"Temple of Magran\" on the map, is an external location in the center of The Sacred Stair, and bears resemblance to this area.\n* This area was removed from the game entirely in patch 5.0.0. It can no longer be accessed without downgrading to an older version of the game.",
