Boxing proved to be the more lucrative venture and he eventually abandoned his forge to devote the entirety of his time to training and fighting. He proved to be quite skilled and quickly rose to prominence in the boxing circuit. He became so confident in his strength that he claimed his hands were strong enough to stop the blade of a sword. He even challenged the renowned duelist Ri Golan to a bout to prove his claim. During the fight, before a cheering crowd, Tuotilo lost his left hand to her sabre.\n\nA hard lesson learned, Tuotilo returned to his forge. Unwilling to admit his time as a master fighter had ended, he forged this impressive shield as a replacement for his missing hand. This new hand could not hold a hammer, but it could strike and parry, and that was good enough for him.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Shield\n| shield_type       = Small shield\n| item_category     = Shield\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 2755\n| shop_value        = 13775\n| deflection_mod    = 10\n| accuracy_mod      = \n| shield_bonuses    = Shield Engagement\n| curr_enchantments = Superb shield (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Brawling;Inward Spikes\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Shield_Small_U_Tuotilos_Palm\n| location          = * [[Periki's Overlook]]: Sold by [[Marihi]] of [[Marihi's Metalwork]].
