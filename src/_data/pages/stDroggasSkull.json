When the temple chose to send a small group of Magranites to spread the word of the faith to the people of the Deadfire (encouraged by the city's duc in an effort to curb growing Vailian influence in the archipelago), Drogga eagerly volunteered to accompany the missionaries.\n\nThe mission served in the eastern islands for years before being slain to the last. Duc Durnsan Hadret hired a group of mercenaries to bring Dyrwoodan justice to the raiders responsible and secure any remains. While the group successfully avenged the missionaries, this grim trophy was all they recovered of the fated group. When the priests at the Shrine of Magran saw that the paladin's flame persisted even in death, they proclaimed her a martyr.\n\nThe Shrine of Magran granted this relic to the chapel at Caed Nua in recognition for your many services to the Dyrwood, and it somehow survived Eothas' rise from below that very structure. Returning again to the Deadfire, St. Drogga continues to cast light into the darkest shadows.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 102\n| shop_value        = 510\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 7\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 13-19 {{slash}}, +20% Damage as Burn\n| damage_type       = -\n| weapon_bonuses    = Accurate (Deadfire){{!}}Accurate\n| curr_enchantments = Torch Flame;Undying Flame\n| weapon_focus      = \n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = LAX00_Torch_U_St_Droggas_Skull\n| location          = * Received as part of the pre-order pack.\n| guid              = 6d81c3d6-b4b4-46f7-8938-364730efec4e\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a sabre in {{poe2}}.
