These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.\n\nIt is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.\n\nThough all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Kalakoth's Sunless Grasp (Deadfire);Concelhaut's Parasitic Staff (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Concelhaut's Corrosive Siphon (Deadfire);Infuse With Vital Essence (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Arduous Delay of Motion (Deadfire);Noxious Burst (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Confusion (Deadfire);Maura's Writhing Tentacles (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Malignant Cloud (Deadfire);Ryngrim's Enervating Terror (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Death Ring (Deadfire);Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Wall of Draining (Deadfire);Ninagauth's Killing Bolt (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Caedebald's Blackbow (Deadfire);Wilting Wind (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Cloak of Death;Concelhaut's Corrosive Skin\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Spore\n| location       = * [[Toaku Biwha Trail]]: Dropped by [[Dank Spore]].\n| guid           = b71e09f4-3c5d-41bd-8e56-f62030fc0773\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
