A retired Aedyran privateer named Tarn Baeris discovered the blade by happenstance in a ruined watchtower on his estate in the Eastern Reach. When the emperor recalled Tarn to service during the War of Defiance, he took the weapon with him.\n\nTarn, no longer a young man, was not enthusiastic about returning to sea, but he served the empire resolutely. He was tasked with interdicting Vailian corsairs who were shipping supplies to rebels in the Dyrwood. An honorable man, Tarn elected to spare the ships and crews he captured after relieving them of their cargo. As such, he rarely found a cause to draw his blade.\n\nTarn's largess would be his undoing, however. Within the year he was killed under a flag of parley while negotiating terms. The corsair who slew him took Tarn's sabre as a trophy.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1157\n| shop_value        = 5785\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 1.0\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 10\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 18-27\n| damage_type       = Slash\n| weapon_bonuses    = Sharp\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Cold Steel\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = Goods and Services\n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sabre_U_Tarns_Respite\n| location          = * Wielded by [[Captain Mad Morena]].\n* Received as a reward for completing [[Goods and Services]].\n| guid              = 75bf33e8-455a-48e7-8d8b-f53031cc57d8\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sabre}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Brittle Frost and Deep Freeze are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Brittle_Frost-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|fc89afa7-b2b4-439e-a374-cd18c4c24eeb}}\n|effect =-1 target [[Deflection]] for 60.0 sec on Hit (stacks 10 times)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =da73b3da-f763-4a1a-a22a-ee4f0a0d9705\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =5a72bd37-59b3-473d-ab2f-a9c44673efa4\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =735bd29f-eb74-4139-8c87-70e2c5f8df98\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Deep_Freeze-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|01264cd5-6ea8-4329-b52d-822fa339d6e3}}\n|effect =-1% target Action Speed for 60.0 sec on Hit (stacks 10 times)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =da73b3da-f763-4a1a-a22a-ee4f0a0d9705\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =5a72bd37-59b3-473d-ab2f-a9c44673efa4\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =0567a1c9-2ce5-479c-a20a-e780d01dff33\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}}}",
