Unable to dissuade his son, Orvyn intended to make sure Nerian would carry something with which to defend himself from the many dangers he would surely encounter.\n\nOrvyn worked for weeks, painstakingly assembling the finest shield he had ever constructed. The blacksmith could not afford expensive wood or fancy leather. Even the rivets were of humble iron. The quality of the craftsmanship however, and the care which Orvyn poured into the shield, made into something greater than the sum of its parts. It was the last gift Nerian would receive from his father, who passed away only several weeks after his departure.\n\nNerian would survive his adventures, eventually retiring to his family home where he took up the smithy's hammer for himself.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Shield\n| shield_type       = Medium shield\n| item_category     = Shield\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1157\n| shop_value        = 5785\n| deflection_mod    = 12\n| accuracy_mod      = -4 \n| shield_bonuses    = Shield Engagement\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional shield (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Father's Aegis \n| poss_enchantments = [[Father's Bastion]] or [[Father's Masterwork]]\n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Shield_Medium_Round_U_Nerians_Ward \n| location          = * The Rotted Lady's Tree in [[Motare o Kōzi]]. \n| guid              = 784b6ce3-f19d-4f98-9d94-76808aee54a7\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Medium shield}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Upgrades ==\n;Note: Father's Bastion and Father's Masterwork are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Fathers_Bastion-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|ea6ea341-6f03-4e70-a814-62f0c39217cc}}\n|effect =+5 Health restored per 3.0 sec for 18.0 sec when below 25% Health\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =ec090111-cbc3-4da3-8b70-d0c20ae9fb2c\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =365b5fc0-a72c-4a5e-b6df-092837b8373b\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =71e7bacc-5b5d-474a-8dd9-9cda84846439\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Fathers_Masterwork-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|71375608-c598-4712-a1fe-403f76e73c2f}}\n|effect =15% of incoming attacks reduced by one level ([[Crit]] to [[Hit]], [[Hit]] to [[Graze]], [[Graze]] to [[Miss]])\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =2698426e-c4ee-457b-8d1c-d55823f06c66\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =88b6a5f3-65c5-49f2-bd8a-49d8bc792645\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =44ad3e99-fd00-4649-aafa-40a8bbefd790\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n}}",
