He'll warn you about the [Giant Cave Grub](/giantCaveGrub/), then will proceed to the ruins.\n** If you didn't kill the grubs, you can lie to him ([Shady](/shady/), [Cruel](/cruel/)).

He'll give you 3 [Glazed Chops](/glazedChops/) from his sachel of provisions.\n* Assuming you led him to safety, the lone survivor thanks you and asks that you visit him in [Port Maje](/portMaje/). Later he can be found in [Port Maje Harbor](/portMajeHarbor/), fishing near your ship's berth. Interacting with him, he thanks you once again and gives you a [Sapphire](/sapphireDeadfire/) and a [Cloak of Greater Deflection](/cloakOfGreaterDeflection/) (though he cannot be talked to in regular conversation).\n\n## Gallery\n\n<gallery>\nPE2_Lone_Survivor_Helped.png | After helping him\n</gallery>\n[Category:Old City characters](/categoryOldCityCharacters/)\n[Category:Port Maje characters](/categoryPortMajeCharacters/)",
