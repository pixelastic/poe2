The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Arcane Assault (Deadfire);Minoletta's Minor Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Rolling Flame (Deadfire);Mirrored Image (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Fireball (Deadfire);Minoletta's Bounding Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Pull of Eora (Deadfire);Wall of Flame (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Blast of Frost (Deadfire);Form of the Helpless Beast (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Chain Lightning (Deadfire);Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire);Delayed Fireball (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Kalakoth's Freezing Rake (Deadfire);Wilting Wind (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Meteor Shower;Minoletta's Missile Salvo\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Starter_Grimoire\n| location       = * Given at the beginning of the game to [[Wizard]]s (including Wizard subclasses and multiclasses)\n| guid           = 8b1a99c6-0725-476d-972e-36e2c8c273c1\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n* Contains the unique 1st level spell [[Arcane Assault (Deadfire)|Arcane Assault]]",
