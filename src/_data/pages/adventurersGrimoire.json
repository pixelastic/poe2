These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.\n\nIt is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.\n\nThough all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Eldritch Aim (Deadfire);Minoletta's Minor Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Arcane Veil (Deadfire);Rolling Flame (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Noxious Burst (Deadfire);Expose Vulnerabilities (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Essential Phantom (Deadfire);Ironskin (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Form of the Helpless Beast (Deadfire);Ninagauth's Bitter Mooring (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Chain Lightning (Deadfire);Death Ring (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Citzal's Martial Power (Deadfire);Delayed Fireball (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Temporal Cocoon;Minoletta's Piercing Sigil (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Citzal's Enchanted Armory;Concelhaut's Corrosive Skin\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire03\n| location       = * [[Queen's Berth]]: Sold by [[Sanza]] of [[Sanza's Map Emporium]].\n* Two copies dropped by Pyromancers in fight with arsonists after automatic scripted interaction in the streets of [[Neketaka]].\n| guid           = c932dd32-eb5a-4cac-be13-6ed7231cd426\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
