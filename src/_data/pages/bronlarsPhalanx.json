He led an elite detachment of pikemen known as the Thorned Wall. Unlike the fercönyg's personal guard unit, the Tall Grass, Bronlar's soldiers had little use for the trappings of ceremony. They needed only their shields and spears.\n\nWhen conflict with the Kulklin bloomed into war, Bronlar received word of enemies marching on the strategically vital bridge at Skerbaen. With no time for dispatches he marched with his single phalanx to hold the crossing. There his force was met by a horde of hostile warriors on the opposite bank. Outnumbered at least five-to-one, Bronlar issued a single imperative.\n\n\"None shall cross.\"\n\nThe Thorned Wall never gave an inch even as they began to fall. Casualties mounting, Bronlar knew his shield wall could not hold forever, so he ordered his men to withdraw and burn the bridge. The warrior king was last seen holding off the advancing enemy force singlehandedly, even as the flames enveloped him. His shield, blackened but unbroken, was later recovered. It now serves as symbol of Aedyran courage and commitment to duty.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Shield\n| shield_type       = Large shield\n| item_category     = Shield\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 3007\n| shop_value        = 15035\n| deflection_mod    = 18\n| accuracy_mod      = -8\n| shield_bonuses    = Shield Engagement\n| curr_enchantments = Superb shield (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Stand Guard;Tactical\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = Bounty - Urnox the Rathun\n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Shield_Large_U_Bronlars_Phalanx \n| location          = * Dropped by [[Urnox Breinth]] on an island near the center of the [[Magran's Teeth]] island chain, during [[Bounty - Urnox the Rathun]]. \n| guid              = b375016e-a6d4-4e1e-b57f-578b7131a8c0\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Large shield}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Upgrades ==\n;Note: Strategist / Tactician and Sentinel / Stand Firm are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Strategist-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|41391637-fdfa-45bd-97b0-14455e182827}}\n|effect =Engaging an enemy for the first time in combat [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Confuses]] them for 30.0 sec\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =2698426e-c4ee-457b-8d1c-d55823f06c66\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =36ca4c42-eefc-4852-9616-5e268dd5802e\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =d953720b-1e8a-4bbb-bd68-e086e6c0d245\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Tactician-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|8448cd96-3039-4889-9a4a-9bcf1ff6ecb8}}\n|effect =Engaging an enemy for the first time in combat Interrupts them\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =2698426e-c4ee-457b-8d1c-d55823f06c66\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =36ca4c42-eefc-4852-9616-5e268dd5802e\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =d953720b-1e8a-4bbb-bd68-e086e6c0d245\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sentinel-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|75dbd507-2186-4fc3-a33e-27af47543c93}}\n|effect =Upgrades [[Stand Guard]], removing the immobility effect\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =862d2279-7e31-45bf-b790-ae22a481548f\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =e1c769f6-0c15-4263-adfd-5801e482208f\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =e36f6414-88cc-43bb-ba7d-c62cad8b03c8\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =1c767eb4-8aed-42ba-96f4-1c6d34e03c08\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =f80c482c-78c1-45da-840e-ce8d4e5adc44\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Stand_Firm-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|d35ae637-1c4f-4780-bf9d-a57c3d625ab2}}\n|effect =Adds Stand Firm to the Stand Guard effect: +1 [[Armor Rating]] and +3 Health every 6.0 sec while under 25% Health\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =2698426e-c4ee-457b-8d1c-d55823f06c66\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =39d03f6f-cd64-41c0-8cec-c97853ed12d3\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =d953720b-1e8a-4bbb-bd68-e086e6c0d245\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =f80c482c-78c1-45da-840e-ce8d4e5adc44\n}}\n}}",
