She will muse on the weather engineering uncovered at Poko Kohara, then ask you to meet [Widla](/widla/), a smuggler, at sea to deliver a special cargo to one of the greatest minds of Rauatai at [Sayuka](/sayuka/). Hazanui Karū hands you {{cp2|1000}}, as the already negotiated payment for the cargo, and sends you on your way.\n* Head west of Neketaka. [Widla](/widla/) and her dhow, ''[The Goshawk](/theGoshawk/)'', will automatically seek you out and make contact. Widla will demand a higher price than agreed for the crates, unless you have at least Good 2 reputation with the Principi.\n** Without the necessary reputation, starting dialogue with the Insight option, mentioning that the \"Royal Deadfire Company has a long memory\", then exhausting all non-hostile dialogue will open dialogue with [Perin](/perin/); a Bluff 6 check will cause Widla to send Perin below deck, removing him if combat breaks out, or a Diplomacy 8 Bluff 6 check will cause Perin to mutiny, sending Widla below deck. Perin will offer the cargo for 1000, otherwise combat is easier as Widla is no longer present.\n** If you chose to attack the crew, interact with the crates on deck to grab them and sail away.\n* Head for Sayuka. Once you make way, you will discover the crates contain a very special kind of cargo: [Iverra](/iverra/), a renowned Vailian scientist. You can talk to her to learn that she deliberately fled the Republics in a crate to test her air-recycling spell and to reach [Sayuka](/sayuka/), in order to help with the excavations there.\n* Upon safe delivery of the \"cargo\" to Sayuka, head to [Fleet Master Okaya](/fleetMasterOkaya/) in her quarters to complete the quest, netting you a measly {{cp2|350}} and Moderate Positive reputation with the RDC.\n\n## Gallery\n\n<gallery mode=nolines>\n Re si crewmemberwithcaptain.png | Loading the crates\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_RDC_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_RDC02_Smugglers.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''A Matter of Import'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Hazanui Karū</b> asked me to pick up an important shipment and deliver it to the island of <b>Sayuka</b>.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| <b>Hazanui Karū</b> has requested my help with a sensitive matter.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Meet <b>Widla</b> at sea at the rendezvous location.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| <b>Widla</b> and her crew are waiting at a predetermined spot <b>west of Neketaka</b>.
