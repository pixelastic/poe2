It operates under the authority of [[Fleet Master Okaya]], the youngest Rauataian in history to hold the title, a valedictorian of the naval academy in [[Takowa]], and a brilliant engineer altogether. Sayuka is of particular interest to the company and the empire, as for some reason, everything - coral, fauna, flora - grows large on Sayuka for reasons unknown - and serves as a research outpost trying to crack the mystery of [[Ondra's Mortar]].\n\nAs a colonial port town, Sayuka is governed by a military governor, in charge of 1,270 denizens (71% coastal aumaua, 27% island aumaua, and 2% other races). The town's major exports are lumber, fish, rice, and medicinal herbs, while it imports wheat, leather, silk, copper, zinc, and cotton textiles. The major religions are Ondra, Magran, Hylea, and Abydon. Sayuka is bound to become a major Rauatai outpost, if it can clear the coral growth affecting its use as a harbor and deal with the druid partisans that have occupied the nearby [[Bentbranch Bog]] and keep raiding the colony.\n\nSome residents of Sayuka say that at one point the town was used as a sort of mental asylum for RDC soldiers who have experienced post-traumatic stress at war.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a fairly small colonial outpost. At the docks you have [[Tebe]] and [[Marofeto Liano]], together with entrance to the workshop. You can find [[Remaro]] to the northeast, near the upper cannon post, with the local merchants by the exit gate.\n* The longhouse houses the local Huana who were supplied with Rauatai housing and gives you an opportunity to learn about the tensions between the aumaua here.\n* Finally, the workshop is to the northeast. After talking to [[Iverra]] about [[Overgrowth]], Sayuka will come under attack by wild beasts, starting [[Hunting Season]].\n* Two fisherman on the pier on the left of the area discuss [[Koīki Fruit]] seeds, brought to the island by none other than [[Ponamu Bird-Scorned]]. The one fisherman planted his share inland, but the other could not get his to weather the winds, and so the first fisherman offers to share his crop with the other.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Tebe]] and the [[undersecretary]], a greeter and a comedy act.\n* [[Marofeto Liano]], a Vailian down on his luck. Offers training (+1 [[Insight]], +1 [[Intimidate]]) for {{cp2|3000}}\n* [[Tipa]], [[Weto]] and [[Riwahi]]: Arguing siblings..\n;Merchants\n* [[Taqua]], sells fish\n* [[Koami]], sell weapons\n;Inside\n* [[Watūri]], [[Osauro]], and [[Nedunga]]: inside the [[Huana longhouse]].\n* [[Fleet Master Okaya]]: inside the [[Fleet Master's quarters]].\n* [[Iverra]] and [[Hetu]]: inside the [[Workshop (Sayuka)|Workshop]].\n;During [[A Sorcerer and a Gentleman]]\n* [[Remaro]], just up the stairs from the docks to the north.\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Stalker's Patience]], [[Distraho]]: Sold by Koami\n* [[Bernhard]] - \"Stray Cat\": At the edge of the pier near Marofeto.\n* [[Sheba]] - \"Lonely Dog\": Located next to the eastern exit, by the fish.\n\n==Gallery==\n<tabber>\nGallery =\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=220px heights=150px>\nPE2 Sayuka Island.png | The island of Sayuka\n</gallery>\n|-|\nBuildings =\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\" style=\"text-align:center\">\nPE2_Workshop_Sayuka_Exterior.png | [[Workshop (Sayuka)|Workshop]]\nPE2_Fleet_Master's_Quarters_Exterior.png | [[Fleet Master's Quarters]]\nPE2_Huana_Longhouse_Exterior.png | [[Huana Longhouse]]\n</gallery>\n|-|\nMap changes =\n;Coral after disabling the machine in [[Overgrowth]]\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\"\">\nPE2_Sayuka_Coral_before.png | Before\nPE2_Sayuka_Coral_after.png | After\n</gallery>\n</tabber>",
