Devio used it to great effect over his bloody career.\n\nHis most noteworthy act of marksmanship took place at the funeral of Agati Salagna, a minor functionary of the Vailian shipwright's guild. The guildsman, though two days' dead - by Devio's hand, no less - drew quite a crowd to his interment service. Throngs of mourners filled the chapel of Berath in the gardens of Revua. Among the crowd was none other than Traria Salagna, the head of the Salagna clan and a brazenly corrupt bureaucrat. She was Devio's target.\n\nDevio, perched atop the nearby ducal mausoleum, was annoyed to find his sightline to Traria obstructed by the chapel bells. While it complicated the shot, it would not save Traria. Devio took aim and fired. The slug punched through the three brass bells, sounding a chime that drowned out the gun's report. The crowd, startled by the sudden cacophony, watched in horror as the Salagna matriarch fell dead, shot cleanly through the heart.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Arquebus\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 4250\n| shop_value        = 21250\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = 12m\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| reload_time       = 6.8\n| area_of_effect    = Target + Length: 15m\n| penetration       = 13\n| handing           = Two-handed\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 15-22\n| damage_type       = Pierce\n| weapon_bonuses    = Inaccurate arquebus (Deadfire){{!}}Inaccurate;Blunted Criticals;Unfit For Melee;Veil Piercing\n| curr_enchantments = Superb weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Unstoppable Shot;Armor Piercing\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Arquebus_U_Three_Bells_Through\n| location          = *Acquired by completing [Maia Rua](/maiaRua/)'s quest [The Courier's Calling](/theCouriersCalling/).\n| guid              = db230fa3-2483-478a-85cc-79e511dd3af5\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is an {{lc:Arquebus}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n##  Description \n\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n##  Acquisition \n\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n## Upgrades\n\n###### Note: Hollow Shot / Mournful Toll and Custom Cartridges / Impactful Chime are mutually exclusive.\n\n{{Pe2crafttable|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Three_Bells_Through_Hollow_Shot-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|f8a7dd4c-3606-4898-ba6f-6077d7f7e4b2}}\n|effect = Attacks [Interrupt](/interrupt/) on [Crit](/crit/)\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =f5ab3a19-47bd-4935-9a27-9c495996fcab\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =b43f6a5c-9627-426c-b605-e6890a16df0b\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =735bd29f-eb74-4139-8c87-70e2c5f8df98\n|q4   =2\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Three_Bells_Through_Mournful_Toll-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|104f07b5-1837-4ce2-a213-bb5958385218}}\n|effect = Raw bleed [Damage](/damage/) over time for 12.0 sec on target on scoring [Crit](/crit/)\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =501e3e97-52e1-4385-9612-5ee2788c0e2d\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =4856e836-930e-470e-be3f-bb6ea7bc58ed\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =3ca52b87-0531-4402-a3e3-bf4b56847387\n|q4   =2\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Three_Bells_Through_Custom_Cartridges-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|123ddb7c-8d16-4bb1-affe-77b8721d0f07}}\n|effect = -10% [Reload Time](/recoverySpeed/)\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =862d2279-7e31-45bf-b790-ae22a481548f\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =4d337c62-b46a-4850-b79d-95eef4368271\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =6c41496b-4cab-47b7-b5f1-34e2929109e8\n|q4   =2\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Three_Bells_Through_Impactful_Chime-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|42a8cb87-eba6-49de-a58c-811f1257e81f}}\n|effect = +10% [Damage](/damage/)\n|cost =6000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =4\n|ing2 =f163ffbf-9539-4e6e-ab78-33fb5519066e\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =e1c769f6-0c15-4263-adfd-5801e482208f\n|q3   =2\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =\n}}\n}}",
