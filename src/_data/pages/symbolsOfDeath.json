  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [faction quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsFactionQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nCaptain Furrante has sent a messenger to summon the Watcher to Dunnage. The Príncipi, head of the Consuaglo mes Casitàs, wishes to discuss a potential business opportunity.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Head to [Dunnage](/dunnage/) and the [Balefire Beacon](/balefireBeacon/). [Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/) will cover matters with [Benweth](/benweth/) first, then proceed to the reason he asked you to come: ''[The Floating Hangman](/theFloatingHangman/)'', a ghost ship haunting the Deadfire. You can react with [Bluff](/bluff/) 8 to boast of your encounters with it, [Arcana](/arcana/) 8 to ask to document it, and [History](/history/) 6 regarding the accounts of a ship flying the Darcozzi flag. The options give a Minor Positive reptuation with the Principi. Furrante will then summon [Selinia](/selinia/), a survivor of the latest attack by the Hangman on their fleet. You can question her on the attack, then Furrante will dismiss her.\n* He will ask you to keep the affair a secret from Aeldys. You can use Perception 17 to figure out that he and Aeldys are at odds regarding the values of the Principi, use Good 1 reputation with the faction to reply in kind, or wait for him to speak. He will then direct you to [the Sacred Stair](/theSacredStair/) in [Neketaka](/neketaka/), to find [Yseyr the Berathian](/yseyrTheBerathian/). If you completed [Eulogy for the Dead](/eulogyForTheDead/), you already have all the knowledge you need to complete the quest right here and now. Otherwise, you need to complete [The Hanging Sepulchers](/theHangingSepulchers/) and find all the eulogy tablets.\n* Next, he will ask you for assistance in a delicate matter...\n\n## Notes\n\n* During or after the completion of this quest, you'll have an encounter with The Floating Hangman first hand - though they spare you:\n{{Description|Out of nowhere, a heavy fog rolls over the ocean, so dense that you cannot see more than a dozen feet out from your ship. With the fog's arrival, the winds die. The waves calm. And The Defiant is left aimlessly drifting, the only sounds that of the hull groaning as if in dread of what's to come.\n\nEerie green lights pierce through the fog as the silhouette of a massive galleon approaches. Black sails, although tattered and rotting, catch in an otherworldly wind, slicing the ship forward at a rapid pace.\n\nThe captain - a skeleton outfitted in tarnished armor, with glowing eyes, surveys you from the quarter deck of the decaying galleon. She raps two fleshless fingers against her chest before pointing right at you.\n\n\"What the goddess of Death has marked, I will leave untouched.\" She nods solemnly, once, then with a tilt of her skull, steers the ship away. As the Floating Hangman turns, several undead sailors shamble across the deck, hungry for a look at your crew. They scratch at the chipped and rotted railing, heads rolling on their exposed spines.\n\nThe ship disappears back into the fog. A few minutes pass before the fog fully dissipates and the winds pick back up, rustling your sails. The sea is clear, empty. The other ship is nowhere to be found.}}\n\n## Gallery\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:RE si fog at sea.png\nFile:RE si fog at sea ghost ship.png\nFile:Re si luscio deathguard.png\nFile:RE si open water.png\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_Principi_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_Principi_Undead.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Symbols of Death'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Captain Furrante</b> has sent a messenger to summon me to <b>Dunnage</b>.
