  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [side quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsSideQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nThe Defiant has run aground, and its crew is dead or scattered. A crew will be of use in maneuvering the ship. Perhaps there are survivors somewhere on the beach. There may be more survivors to be found. \n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* The goal is to collect the remnants of your crew. There are several to be had:\n** [Irrena](/irrena/) is up on the deck and needs [Survival](/survival/) 2 or [Lay on Hands](/layOnHandsDeadfire/) to heal her or [Athletics](/athletics/) 2 / [Might](/might/) 15 to help her down from the ship. If you have no Survival, Eder's party assist should help.\n** [Chitupec](/chitupec/) is near the center of the beach if you elected to save him during the prologue and will point you towards Beodulf in the cave.\n** [Eld Engrim](/eldEngrim/) is the easiest to get, as he's waiting just up the road.\n** [Beodul](/beodul/) is located inside the cave, near the upper center, surrounded by a ton of bear traps. You can disable the traps ([Mechanics](/mechanics/) 1), guide him through ([Perception](/perception/) 11), call him a coward and make him pass through them ([Bluff](/bluff/) 2), or set the traps off with stones ([Intellect](/intellect/) 13 or [Sleight of Hand](/sleightOfHand/) 2). Alternatively, you can initiate combat with the enemy construct to the East, use it to activate one of the traps, and if Beodul survives combat, he will be freed. \n* Gathering them up completes the quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/09_Port_Maje/09_QST_Crew_Members.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Helping Hands'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>The Defiant</b> has run aground, and its crew is dead or scattered.
