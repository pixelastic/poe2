  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTheForgottenSanctum/) in {{lax3}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nIt appears that something has ''violently'' escaped the Collections wing of the Halls Obscured. Exploring the wing could help reveal more about this facility.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This quest is started by entering the Collections wing and will require the player to reach [The Assembly of Echoes](/theAssemblyOfEchoes/), accessible through the [Hall of Reconfiguration](/hallOfReconfiguration/) (using the vithrack elevator). The exit lies to the south and requires the player to fight the Memory Hoarder, tied to the forgotten archmage [Fyonlecg](/fyonlecg/). Killing it will complete the quest and grant access to the aperture required to complete [A Shout in the Dark](/aShoutInTheDark/).\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX03_Forgotten_Sanctum/lax03_cp_qst_03.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Under Observation'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Something appears to have violently escaped the <b>Collections</b> wing of the Halls Obscured.
