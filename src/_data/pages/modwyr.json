It is possessed by a somewhat filthy-minded spirit that talks to [the Watcher](/theWatcher/) and wants them to find its owner.\n\nSaid owner, [Yngfrith](/yngfrith/), is found in [Dunnage](/dunnage/) at the [Radiant Court](/radiantCourt/). After the conversation, if you keep the sword, it is no longer soulbound to the Watcher but becomes a unique weapon. You can still speak to it by selecting the conversation option in the Watcher's icon bar.\n\n## Background\n\nModwyr is an unique blade in more than one way. After earning at least two levels, she will confess that her owner dumped her before heading for [Dunnage](/dunnage/) - and you can learn why if you have Diplomacy 2 and either the Benevolent, Honest, or Diplomatic reputation. She simply couldn't take it anymore and threw Modwyr away in the trash.\n\n##  Description \n\n###### Base\n\n{{Description|{{#var:description}}}}\n\n###### Level 1\n\n{{Description|THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

Joy, bright and buoyant, that grows with every swing, with every slick splash of hot blood across my blade. It almost feels right. I almost feel like... me. But I'm not me without her, am I, and what did she do? She left me behind. Abandoned me.\n\nThis one will, too.\n\nBut maybe I'll get lucky. Maybe we'll get to Dunnage before they realize they don't want me.\n}}\n\n###### Level 3\n\n{{Description|Something's not right.\n\nWe were good at first. A real team. The way we fought - it wasn't the same as it was with Yngfrith, but it wasn't bad, either. There was a fire between us, and it roared when we killed. I felt... alive. Like things might be okay. That this one might not leave me after all.\n\nBut that fire died. What if it doesn't return?\n\nI can't go back to being alone. I can't.
