All she wanted were a written log what showed our work. So, here goes.\n\nCaptain Fyrgist of the Black Isle Bastards\n\n1. Jerek, Aedyran peasant. Pissed himself when I pressed my cutlass to his neck.\n<br/>2. Mess ler, 31st of his name. Not so high and mighty anymore.\n<br/>3. Corpse with exactly 333 odd coins on him. Swear I seen him before.\n<br/>4. Godlike, looked like a lionfish. Dove to the waves, lost.\n<br/>5. Katharak. Spider-headed, bristling with guns.\n<br/>6. Abyda. Ransomed, no takers. Sold to Crookspur.\n<br/>7. Endre Warg. Animancer. Tossed overboard with his device.\n<br/>8. Gambling monk. Stole his dice, his winnings, his life.\n<br/>9. Andresi Nunes. Darcozzi. Shiny armor didn't stop a cannonball.\n<br/>10. Man with a sack of wooden rats and a jar of ashes? Got rid of him quick.\n<br/>11. Lightfoot - keelhauled. May have poisoned our rum.\n<br/>12. Another floater. Had a note pinned to his forehead - Perebor. Someone got to him first.\n<br/>13. Mad dwarf ran off a pier before we could kill him. Shame, really.\n<br/>14. Lord Siman of the Marsh.
