Zamar's debts have left him vulnerable to a local pirate gang, and he seeks a way out of his troubles.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nHead over to the shipyard in [Queen's Berth](/queensBerth/) (northwestern corner of the area) and talk to [Zamar](/zamar/) to learn that [Captain Radora](/captainRadora/) reneged on her payments. You are asked to track her down at [The Wild Mare](/theWildMare/).\n\n######  Find Captain Radora\n\n* Talk to Radora at [The Wild Mare](/theWildMare/), or [Tiela](/tiela/) - an emaciated girl watching the magic show at the northern back alley, or both.\n** [Captain Radora](/captainRadora/) will tell that cutpurses ambushed her and stole Zamar's coin. The thugs got the drop on her in the northern alleys of Queen's Berth. With [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 2 you can connect this gang to the pirates pressuring the old shipwright.\n** [Tiela](/tiela/) will tell you that the pirates pressuring Zamar are the very same thugs who robbed Radora, also that they only appear at night. You can skip Radora if you talk to her. Incidentally, you can give the emaciated girl an egg if you have any.\n\n######  Confront Cotta (optional)\n\n*Find [Cotta](/cotta/) and his gang in the alley at night. You can:\n**'''Attack.''' The Príncipi thugs will keep bothering Zamar as long as they're alive. Killing them can be difficult at lower levels, as you're up against a well-balanced group of Príncipi with a powerful wolf companion. Upon disposing of them, return to Zamar.\n*** The fight can be easily dealt with by targeting the middle Powder Barrel of the three on the corner (with a gun, fire or electric attack). The explosion will kill nearly all of the group and leave the farthest gang member back in the alley and possibly the wolf. Beware to approach the discussion with your highest reflex or HP party member.\n*** You can target the Powder Barrel before the discussion, pause just before it explodes and start the discussion. The barrels will explode as soon as combat starts, giving no time for the enemies to run around so you can position your front line out of the blast zone.\n*** Afterwards, you can return to Radora to get moderate positive reputation with the Vailian Trading Company.\n*** You can attack the gang early in the conversation with Cotta, without incuring any disposition or reputation gain (or loss):\n***#''[Pull spirits from the In-Between]'' or ''[Say nothing]''\n***#''\"Someone robbed Captain Radora. (...)\"''\n***#''\"[Attack] Only cowards attack from behind.\"''\n** '''[Intimidate](/intimidate/) 4 - Threaten Cotta to leave Zamar alone ([Animal Cruelty](/animalCruelty/)) [<nowiki/>[Aggressive](/dispositionAggressive/)] .''' You lose moderate reputation with the Príncipi. This will turn into a fight unless you pass one of the following check (plus another minor reputation lost with the Príncipi):\n***[Streetwise](/streetwise/) 6: ''\"You and your mangy friend have to sleep sometime.\"'' ([Animal Cruelty](/animalCruelty/)) [<nowiki/>[Aggressive](/dispositionAggressive/)]\n*** [History](/history/) 5: ''\"Clussa's Voyage would be a mercy compared to what I have planned for you.\"'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[Clever](/clever/)<nowiki>]</nowiki>  \n***Might 20: \"''Do you honestly think you can take me?''\"\n***[Streetfighter](/streetfighter/) (Rogue subclass).\n** '''Follow through with Cotta's plan:''' Force Zamar on an \"exclusive contract\" for the Príncipi, which results in a minor reputation gain with the Príncipi, a minor negative with [Maia](/maiaRua/) if she's present, and {{cp2|700}} ({{cp2|200}} in advance and {{cp2|500}} after completion). Note that you can still go back on your word and attack them after agreeing to the deal.\n\n######  Go back to Zamar\n\n* If you avoided Cotta and his gang altogether, tell him Radora was robbed and offer to buy her commission. You'll get 4 [Iron Thunderer](/ironThunderer/) for {{cp2|1000}} ({{cp2|1500}} if you have [Maia](/maiaRua/) with you, and if you have a Rational disposition of 2 Zamar will knock the price down to 500 if you question whether that is \"all you get\"). The cannons cost {{cp2|4800}} if you buy it normally without any discount so it's a good buy. Even if you don't need the cannons, you can sell them for {{cp2|960}}. You can still go talk to Cotta even after having bought Radora's commission. However, you'll not be able to make any meaningful conversation with them, i.e. the dialogue pertaining to Zamar and Radora isn't available.\n* If you ''dealt'' with Cotta, tell him the pirates won't be bothering him anymore. You can still offer to buy Radora's commission like the above option.\n* If you agreed to Cotta's deal, convince him to work for the Príncipi. Unless you reported that Radora was robbed beforehand, no cannons for you. Note that you can still go back and kill Cotta. Just shoot the Powder Barrel and cast fireball on top of it.\n* You get 10% discount at Zamar's shop regardless of how you resolve the situation.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/03_Neketaka_Vailian_District/03_TSK_Shipwrights_Plight.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Shipwright's Plight'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Captain Radora</b> owes money to <b>Zamar</b> the shipwright.
