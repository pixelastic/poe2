  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [location](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireWorldMap/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Gullet represents the slums of the great city of [Neketaka](/neketaka/). Located deep within the island, in the shadow of the splendor of [Serpent's Crown](/serpentsCrown/) or [Periki's Overlook](/perikisOverlook/), the Gullet is suspended against the massive waterfall that dominates the center of the island. The slums of Neketaka are home to both the Roparu caste of the city's Huana as well as myriad colorful and unsavory figures. Built in a great chasm at the heart of Neketaka, it is where much of the city's refuse, literal and figurative, comes to rest.\n\nThe Gullet is home to the Roparu in Neketaka, the lowest caste in Huana society. By Huana tradition, food is distributed from the highest caste to the lowest, as the queen sees fit.\nThis uneven distribution of resources, coupled with an influx of refugees from other islands in the Deadfire, is starving the Roparu to death.\n\n## Points of interest\n\n* The northeastern area has the lift to the [Old City](/oldCity/). As you enter the area, you're treated to an example of how the justice system in the Gullet works: [Botaro](/botaro/) is dragged to a rusty cage over the abyss, to be dumped into the [Old City](/oldCity/) below.
