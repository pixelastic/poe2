The spells bearing his name focus largely on illusion and pain - qualities that he prizes in his personal life and teaching philosophy. Over the years he has fostered dozens of students, but none have graduated from their apprenticeship to Arkemyr's satisfaction - opting instead to leave his service in bitterness and resentment over the archmage's notoriously unfair treatment. [Fessina](/fessina/), his latest apprentice, bears a particular disdain against Arkemyr, calling him the \"Bringer of Foul Wind, the Teat of Suckling Imps, and the Herald of Dirty Slippers.\" He currently lives in Neketaka at Periki's Overlook, where he operates a local magic shop - the Dark Cupboard. \n\nArkemyr is a member of the [Circle of Archmagi](/circleOfArchmagi/). Depending on who you ask, it's either Eora's equivalent of the Avengers or a club for bumbling fools jumped up on magic. As [Aloth](/aloth/) points out, the involvement is typically the worst possible outcome, as per the Blackwash Falls incident, where all the water instantly disappeared. Arkemyr's quite in favor of the former opinion, but he's no less annoyed by the fact that he drew the short straw for this decade and had to relocate his estate halfway across the known world to keep an eye on the Deadfire Archipelago.\n\nHe is disliked by other archmagi, especially [Llengrath](/llengrath/). He is a deceptive snake, after all: He relocated his estate to Neketaka after convincing the powers that be that the Kahanga Palace was structurally unstable... And financing the renovations.\n\n## Interactions\n\n{{Interactions\n|companion       =\n|wares           =\n|stronghold      =\n|rest            =\n|quests_started  = [Bekarna's Folly](/bekarnasFolly/)\n|quests_involved = [A Cordial Invitation](/aCordialInvitation/)\n|none            = \n|other           = * With the [Waterlogged Journal](/waterloggedJournal/) in your inventory, you can ask him about \"The Sanguine Harvest\".\n* If you wear [Arkemyr's Old Robe](/arkemyrsOldRobe/), or if one of your companion wears them, this triggers unique dialogue with Arkrmyr.\n* If you killed [Concelhaut](/concelhaut/) in {{px1}} or [Llengrath](/llengrath/) in {{tfs}}, he brings this up.\n* With [Aloth](/aloth/) in the party, he will bring up the Blackwash Falls incident when Arkemyr asks for your help in preparing for the \"worst possible outcome\".\n* You can tattletale on [Fassina](/fassina/) for giving you the [key](/arkemyrsManorKey/) to Arkemyr's Manor.\n* With Fassina in the party, he'll have a particularly unsavoury reaction towards her presence in the manor.\n}}\n\n## =Quests\n\n=\n* [A Cordial Invitation](/aCordialInvitation/) to [Bekarna's Folly](/bekarnasFolly/): Arkemyr invites you over to discuss his vault.
