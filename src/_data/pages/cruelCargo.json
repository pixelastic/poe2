  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [side quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsSideQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nRuāsare, the Wahaki chieftain, seeks vengeance on the slavers of Crookspur. Many of her tribesman have been taken into bondage. She wants the leadership of Crookspur killed. The center of the slaver operations is a small fortress on Crookspur near the tip of the island. The slaver fortress is known to be well defended.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This quest is received as an extension to [Fruitful Alliance](/fruitfulAlliance/), as part of [Ruāsare](/ruasare/)'s terms of alliance with the [Huana](/huana/). It can also be done concurrently to [Clearing Out Crookspur](/clearingOutCrookspur/).\n* This is a quest that can be tackled in a variety of ways, but ultimately requires both freeing the Wahaki slaves from captivity, and purging the slavers from the island. For a detailed walkthrough, see the quest [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdPropositionAgainstCrookspur/).\n* Note that once you free either of the slaves, the fort will be put on alert. If you have started [Tip of the Spear](/tipOfTheSpear/), this will fail that quest, you will also be unable to do [Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/)'s side of [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/).\n* Once [Master Kua](/masterKua/) is dead, take his [head](/headOfMasterKua/) and return to [Ruāsare](/ruasare/) to complete the quest.\n{{-}}\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/16_Wahaki_Island/16_qst_wahaki.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Cruel Cargo '''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Ruāsare</b>, the Wahaki chieftain, seeks vengeance on the <b>slavers</b> of <b>Crookspur</b>.
