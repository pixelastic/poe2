Pitli, a priestess from the Children of the Dawnstars, is caring for them in secret and needs medicine.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* [Pitli](/pitli/) believes that Delver's Row can provide the necessary medicine. She doesn't know how to get there, but thinks that people who hang out at the local tavern might.\n* You can talk to Overseer Hitengo about this and the sick will be taken away and likely die.\n*Speak to [Fyrna](/fyrna/) at [The Hole](/theHole/) regarding the location of [Delver's Row](/delversRow/) (or see [The Narrows](/theNarrows/) for details), and then make your way there.\n* Once in Delver's Row, talk to [Ernezzo](/ernezzo/) in his shop to the northwest of the area. You can either pay {{cp2|800}} for the medicine, or do a little favor for him - kill [The Spindle Man](/theSpindleMan/).\n** Talking to [The Spindle Man](/theSpindleMan/) will reveal a hidden entrance to the storeroom if you reveal Ernezzo's plans towards him. He will ask that you kill Ernezzo instead. In exchange, The Spindle Man promises to give you better prices (a 10% discount) at his store.\n** You can also hire [Rust](/rust/) to assassinate either Ernezzo (for {{cp2|300}}) or The Spindle Man (for {{cp2|600}} - due to the additional guards). Rust will take a day to get the job done. You can also ask him about the cure to drowner's lung, he'll think you're diseased and point you towards [Ernezzo](/ernezzo/).\n** Alternatively, you can sneak into the side room and steal the medicine yourself.\n** Another option is just to kill Enezzo for the medicine. His gang leave the shop at night to drink, meaning less enemies to deal with.\n* Either way, once you've retrieved the [Drowner's Lung Medicine](/drownersLungMedicine/), return to [Pitli](/pitli/). You can demand payment or just give it to her for a warm fuzzy feeling and [Halgot's Warmth](/halgotsWarmth/), a unique ring.\n* Once you leave Pitli's Sanctuary, you will be contacted by a [Cloaked Messenger](/cloakedMessenger/) who will invite you to meet [Dereo the Lean](/dereoTheLean/) at [his lair](/dereosLair/) in [The Narrows](/theNarrows/). This is one of [multiple ways](/dereosLair/) you can gain access to the lair.\n\n## Notes\n\n* After accepting the offer to kill [the Spindle Man](/theSpindleMan/) and informing him of the request of [Ernezzo](/ernezzo/) to have him killed. He will ask you to kill [Ernezzo](/ernezzo/) instead though most likely  turning the whole [Delver's Row](/delversRow/) against you, using a [Delayed Fireball](/delayedFireball/) then closing the door can accomplish the task without angering anyone but his guards who can't see you.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/06_Neketaka_Slums_District/06_QST_Cold_Hard_Hope.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Harsh Medicine'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| Several Roparu in the <b>Gullet</b> have fallen ill with drowner's lung, a deadly and contagious disease. <b>Pitli,</b> a priestess from the Children of the Dawnstars, is caring for them in secret and needs medicine.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Go to <b>Delver's Row</b> in the Gullet.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| <b>Pitli</b> thinks I could find the medicine she needs on <b>Delver's Row</b>.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20001\n| Pitli doesn't know how to reach Delver's Row, but the people that hang around the <b>tavern</b> might.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Find drowner's lung medicine on <b>Delver's Row</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| Delver's Row is bustling with shops and suspicious characters.
