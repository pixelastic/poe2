A bomb must have gone off in Serpent's Crown - one of revelation if not black powder. The interruption is a setback. I trust that whatever happens next will propel our people forward? I will sail Periki's Resolve into the waters where I suspect you need me most and await your orders. I hope that the rumors carried upon the waves are to be trusted. I would tell you to send Onekaza my love, but she knows that it is hers. Tell her that she needs only snap her fingers and I will be her storm again.\n\nDaraku, Master Watershaper\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Document\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_Daraku_Note\n| location       = \n| guid           =b91f2c41-71a9-4b4f-b28d-1b3ff7e6a61e\n\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Document }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
