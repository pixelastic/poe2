Unlike many, his devotion to the future of his people was never diminished by his own agendas and he always considered himself to be the protector of the Príncipi as an emerging civilization. \n\nFurrante has taken a keen interest in the Watcher, believing that only a fool - say, [Benweth](/benweth/) of the Drake - would try to kill a potential asset. He believes that the Watcher can be a powerful ally in his little private war with [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/) and would like to see them on his side. As the old blood of the Principi, Furrante still yearns for a new homeland, a Patrena for the Princes - and Ukaizo is exactly what he needs.\n\nFurrante captains the dhow ''[The Gentleman of Leisure](/theGentlemanOfLeisure/)'', and [Serafen](/serafen/) is one of his crew members.\n\n## Interactions\n\n{{Interactions\n|companion       =\n|wares           =\n|stronghold      =\n|rest            =\n|quests_started  = [Blow the Man Down](/blowTheManDown/)<br/>[Symbols of Death](/symbolsOfDeath/)<Br/>[A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/)<br/>[Honor Among Thieves](/honorAmongThieves/)\n|quests_involved =\n|none            = \n|other           =\n}}\n\n## =Quests\n\n=\n* [Blow the Man Down](/blowTheManDown/): You are intercepted on the world map by Captain Furrente, who asks you to dispose of Benweth and lends you [Serafen](/serafen/), his best shiphunter.\n* [Symbols of Death](/symbolsOfDeath/): He sends you out to learn information needed to take the Floating Hangman out - or make it support the Principi.\n* [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/): Furrante will let you in on the secret of his contacts with slavers and the VTC.\n* [Honor Among Thieves](/honorAmongThieves/): Furrante wants to eliminate [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/).
