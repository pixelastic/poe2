Though confrontational and divisive, she feels that the tribe will prove a critical ally in the contentious days ahead.\nThe tribe can be found on [Ori o Koīki](/oriOKoiki/), a fiercely protected island of dense jungle, to the northwest of Neketaka.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Leave Neketaka and head northwest towards Ori o Koīki. Once you get to the island, head east and speak to [Kipeha](/kipeha/) - a tribe member keeping guard of the lift up to the village. She cautions you to head back to your ship (strangely in past-tense). Naturally, she won't be willing to let a bunch of strangers in, but you can convince her with one of the following:\n** {{cp2|1000}} and either the Deadfire Archipelago background or [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 5 ([Huana](/huana/): Minor Positive)\n** [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 8 or [Insight](/insight/) 9 to tell her that you desire a \"deeper understanding of their tribe\" (Pro-Huana) - the checks following don't matter.\n** Tell her that the Queen wishes an alliance with the Wahaki - using the treaty phrase \"Over crumbling mountains, across blighted seas\". If you fail to recall the phrase, she'll fire an arrow at your head (you can dodge it with [Athletics](/athletics/) 7) and put the tribe on alert.\n** If you've started the concurrent quest [Tip of the Spear](/tipOfTheSpear/), you can warn them that the [Crookspur](/crookspur/) slavers seek vengeance against the Wahiki tribe - the checks following don't matter. \n* Once you gain access to the village talk to the ranga, [Ruāsare](/ruasare/), to learn her terms: Wipe out the slavers at [Crookspur](/crookspur/) and in return, she will support the crown.\n** After clearing out the slavers, and in the wake of Rauataian warships taking over Crookspur island, you have to pass a skill check (4 [Streetwise](/streetwise/) / 5 [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/)) for her to accept the authority of the Queen.\n* This starts the quest [Cruel Cargo](/cruelCargo/). Complete this quest then return to the queen for your reward; {{cp2|2500}} and Major Positive reputation with Huana.\n* Otherwise, if you failed to gain access, started combat with the tribe, or if [Ruāsare](/ruasare/) is killed, the quest will be over and you'll be forced to explain yourself to the Queen.\n{{-}}\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_Huana_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_04_The_Wahaki.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Fruitful Alliance'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Queen Onekaza</b> has asked me to recruit the <b>Wahaki</b> tribe to her cause.
