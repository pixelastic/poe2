Based on this, I would be inclined to conclude that the Sanguine Harvest are little more than a story. But how is one to explain the disappearances of innocent kith around the 16th of the month?\n\nWhat may have befallen these poor souls is dismal indeed. Those few I spoke to who claimed knowledge of the Sanguine Harvest would swear to me only that they received it secondhand, and they had this to say:\n\nOn the 16th of every month, the Sanguine Harvest choose one unlucky captive to kneel before their altar and become fodder for a cabal of fampyrs. Through this act, the leader, or 'Grand Harvester,' empowers a fearful, soul-draining greatsword. To what end the Grand Harvester then puts this sword is unknown.\n\nThe cult members, or 'Harvest Cantors,' then dance around a fire in a state of mindless, ecstatic joy.\n\nThey clothe themselves in robes of black edged in red, and on their robes is the image of a large dagger cutting three kith in half.\n\nIt sounds too ridiculous to believe, does it not? And yet, I wonder.\"\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Document\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_UCI_11_Sanguine_Harvest_Cult\n| location       = * [[Arkemyr's Manor]]: Bedroom, in the bookcase on the wall.\n| guid           =bec798a8-c963-4703-9268-ff5d1e748316\n\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Document }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
