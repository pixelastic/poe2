The eulogy rests in the catacombs under the Sacred Stair, a place where only those marked by Berath may enter.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Visit High Priest Kasu (Temple of Berath) to start the quest. Nearing death, he wants to obtain the eulogy, but explains that the tombs only open to those baring Berath's chime. Kasu gives you [The Eel's Coil](/theEelsCoil/), an item which will resonate with your \"chime\" to open the entrance to [The Hanging Sepulchers](/theHangingSepulchers/), found on the lower walkway outside the temple.\n* The eulogy itself was split into three odes written by Yseyr's champions, and placed next to their tombs. Finding those tombs will be the first step. The locations of the tombs are covered on the page [The Hanging Sepulchers](/theHangingSepulchers/), including a way to talk Yseyr himself down.\n* Once you have obtained all three tablets ([Eulogy to Yseyr - The Vigil](/eulogyToYseyrTheVigil/), [Eulogy to Yseyr - The Gate](/eulogyToYseyrTheGate/), and [Eulogy to Yseyr - The Sword](/eulogyToYseyrTheSword/)) return to the priest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/07_Neketaka_Temple_District/07_QST_Eulogy.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Eulogy for the Dead'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Kasu</b>, High Priest of Berath, wants to recover a sacred text, the <b>Eulogy of Yseyr</b>.
