The country was suffering from a plague of [Hollowborn](/hollowborn/), infants born without [soul](/soul/)s, that many believed was punishment for killing the god.

After passing through some [Engwithan](/engwithan/) ruins, they stumble across a secret ritual that inadvertently transformed them into a [Watcher](/watcher/), one who can see and speak with souls.

After communing with a dead [animancer](/animancy/) ([Caldara de Berranzi](/caldaraDeBerranzi/)) the player learns that they are a Watcher (and becomes known as \"the Watcher\"). The animancer directs them to [Maerwald](/maerwald/), a watcher at [Caed Nua](/caedNua/). Unfortunately, Maerwald also has an awakened soul, and the visions of his past life have driven him crazy. In his confusion he attacks the Watcher, who is forced to kill him. The Watcher then becomes the owner of Caed Nua.\n\nPrior to his death, Maerwald gave the Watcher a lead to seek a group known as the [Leaden Key](/leadenKey/) in the city of [Defiance Bay](/defianceBay/). After investigating the group with the aid of a local cipher ([Lady Webb](/ladyWebb/)), the Watcher learns that a man named [Thaos ix Arkannon](/thaosIxArkannon/) had led the ritual that awakened their soul.
