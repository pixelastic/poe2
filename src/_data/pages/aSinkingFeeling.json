She suggested the Watcher start with Zili, a more easygoing member of the Valera family.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* After [Salt in the Wound](/saltInTheWound/), head to the Bardatto estate and talk to [Ezzali Bardatto](/ezzaliBardatto/). Talk to her and she will reveal that there are rumors of a Valera plot against her family. She will ask that you go and interrogate [Zili Valera](/ziliValera/) by the watchtowers to learn of the plans. Talk to him and he will tell you to find [Persa](/persa/) in [The Hole](/theHole/).\n* Head to the Hole, in the Gullet district of Neketaka. Persa is standing in the store room with [Baer](/baer/). You can eavesdrop on them in stealth mode. If they notice you, Persa will immediately question your presence. You can use Bluff 2 and Might to get out (but this will not advance the quest). Use Perception 16/Insight 3 to identify Baer as a Bardatto guard and you'll have to fight the whole group.\n* Once you have the information, return to Ezzali.\n\n##  Bugs \n\n*If you have been caught by Persa once already but talked your way out of a fight, the trigger for being caught the second time doesn't disappear even after the quest has concluded and the conspirators are no longer at the Hole. This causes forced dialogue with the now-absent Baer, but doesn't appear to cause any other issues.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/03_Neketaka_Vailian_District/03_TSK_Bardatto_Favor.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''A Sinking Feeling'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Ezzali Bardatto</b> is convinced that the <b>Valera family</b> is planning to make a move against her.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Find <b>Zili Valera</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| <b>Ezzali Bardatto</b> asked me to seek out information regarding a Valera plot against her.
