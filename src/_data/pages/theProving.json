  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsSeekerSlayerSurvivor/) in {{lax1}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nAs the Watcher sets sail on the Deadfire, the [Steward](/steward/) requests their presence. It seems someone has slipped a crate onto the ship, one marked as \"beans\", but which contains nothing of the sort.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* You receive the notification that the Steward wants to talk to you when you enter the world map after installing the DLC and finishing [He Waits in Fire](/heWaitsInFire/). Go down to the ship, then into the hold. The Steward will explain the situation and point you towards the box, which sits in the hold, northeastern end. Interact with it.\n{{description|Not far in you find the crate in question, its sides split by crowbars, the dry grass used as packing material spilled across the floor. Within stands an intricately crafted chest of some dark tropical wood. A polished visage peers up at you - a triumvirate of wild animal faces carved in the swirling Huana style.\n\nThe front of the chest bears an iron latch affixed to a complex iron mechanism that runs to the top four corners of the chest. You see no bolts or keyholes.}}\n* The mysterious package is an ornately carved box. With Religion 5, you can identify the spider, stelgaer, and boar carved on it as representations of Toamowhai, the shapeshifting god of the island wilds. Mechanics 5 allows for inspecting the package for traps (there are none).\n* The box will contain a severed head. The Watcher powers will let a spirit of an [aumaua](/aumaua/) coalesce in the hold. [Muātu](/muatu/) will request your aid as a Watcher, at the island of [Kazuwari](/kazuwari/) (west of [Hasongo](/hasongo/)). [Konstanten](/konstanten/) will pitch in and suggest that you throw the entire box overboard, but refuse to explain in detail just why.\n* Head over to Kazuwari. Before you make land at the secret waterfall, you are visited by one of [Galawain](/galawain/)'s beasts, then by the god of the hunt himself. Chewing you out for trying to come to the island (and wrecking [Cignath Mór](/cignathMor/) if you did it, and/or slaughtering Archdruid [Rehestin](/rehstin/) and '''[Ethik Nôl](/ethikNol/) during PoE1'''), he will warn you to leave the island (which, of course, is pretty much a direct invitation for the Watcher).\n* Land and make your way over to [Rebūtara Pass](/rebutaraPass/), where you will come upon the skeleton of a gigantic beast. You may examine the scene through a series of skill checks:\n** Identify the skeleton: Survival 13\n** Investigate the scene by the skeleton: Survival 10\n** Examine the corpse: Religion 12\n** Examine the decorations: History 10\n** Loot the body: Streetwise 8 (to reveal a hidden coin purse)\n** Sneak away: Stealth 18\n* If successfully sneaking away, you will see a group of druids and a lot of boars coming down the road. You may avoid or approach them. If strolling down the road, you will be accosted by the same group, led by [Hateno](/hateno/) and [Scibéal](/scibeal/). Dealing with them diplomatically is difficult, largely impossible, even if you dealt with the aumaua hermit on [Maje Island](/majeIsland/), (being godlike helps the intimidation option) and acquired the [Wise Teeth Necklace](/wiseTeethNecklace/) or brought [Konstanten](/konstanten/) along. Fighting them can be challenging, as you're fighting four druids/rangers backed up by a razorback group.\n* To resolve the situation without a fight, you should rely on showing strength rather than diplomacy. Show them the Wise Teeth Necklace, assert that you belong on the island as much as they do, and refer to how you healed the Green Lady of Motare o Kozi thus being recognized as a champion of nature. They'll let [Toamowhai](/toamowhai/) judge your worth, letting you pass. ''(Whether or not Konstanten's presence helps is unsure)''\n* After wiping them out, Konstanten will reveal that he was a part of the contests at the island and quit while he was still ahead. He will also offer to provide insight and information wherever you go. Your goal is the arena in the center, accessible either through the well at Huaba Maha Depths or the doors at Hiuahariki Depths (see [Kazuwari](/kazuwari/) for details). \n** Entering through the well puts you inside the challenger's chamber. You will be \"greeted\" by the Arena Warden, who makes the logical conclusion that the group now in the challenger's chamber are the challengers. Any attempts at telling him otherwise have him accusing you of getting cold feet, and as such your only way forward is to exit the room and enter the challenge. Such are the rewards for trying to sneak in, instead of using the front door, like normal people. Fight a Tyrant of Decay, which concludes your first challenge. When you're back in the challenger's chamber, the Warden will be somewhat flustered for not verifying that you were actually a challenger as such. You're pointed towards Humaire, in the Hall of Memories.\n** If going in by way of Hiuahariki Rise, the wardens who intercept you at the entrance will greet and direct you to talk to [Humaire](/humaire/). However, first you need to ascend to the spectator stands at the arena and witness the slaughter in the ring. The Faces will celebrate those vanquished in the fight for their contribution, before [Humaire](/humaire/) approaches you and welcomes to the Crucible.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>quests/lax01_00_arena_island/lax01_00_qst_main_quest_01.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Proving'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| The steward has informed me that the crew has discovered a piece of <b>cargo</b> buried <b>deep within the hull of [Player Ship].</b>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Open the <b>strange package</b> found on your ship.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| I should return to <b>[Player Ship]</b> to investigate this mysterious cargo.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Sail to <b>Kazuwari</b> in the western Deadfire Sea.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| The package contained the severed head of an aumaua named Muātu.
