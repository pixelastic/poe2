Contrary to traditional monastic beliefs which embraced pain, Endre believed pain was nothing but an illusion. It was merely a projection of weakness, and weakness had to be purged. He engaged in brutal self-flagellation as a catalyst for his transcendence, using this vicious flail for the bloody ritual.\n\nHis extreme practices were cautiously tolerated by his monastic brothers. However, when Endre declared himself first among equals and demanded the obedience of his fellow warriors, they immediately decried his fanaticism. Endre saw his first task as self-appointed leader would be to bring his wayward brothers to heel. If they would not bleed of their own volition, he would bleed them.\n\nThe resulting melee was a bloody affair. It seemed Endre had indeed acquired great power through his suffering. Despite his wounds, his fellow monks were unable to match his prowess. The battle ended only when Endre was shot with several arrows. He died standing, his gore-covered flail still in hand.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Flail\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1065\n| shop_value        = 5325\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.5\n| recovery_time     = 3.0\n| penetration       = 9\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 13-18 {{Crush}}, +10% Damage as Pierce\n| damage_type       = -\n| weapon_bonuses    = Arcing Blows\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional; Will Breaker\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Flail_U_Endres_Flog_of_Obedience\n| location          = * Dropped by [[Katrenn]] during [[Bounty - Katrenn]].\n| guid              = 5901e96e-613a-4bcf-9e2c-0b55f0ca3ed3\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Flail}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Relentless Torture and Tortured Mind are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Relentless_Torture-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|6f7b8b6c-5d0f-4c4d-ba41-da01cc83618a}}\n|effect =+2 [[Penetration]] against targets affected by [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Mind Afflictions]]\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =b43f6a5c-9627-426c-b605-e6890a16df0b\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =36ca4c42-eefc-4852-9616-5e268dd5802e\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =a10541f0-c4f2-44dc-8300-f8b13ed615df\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Tortured_Mind-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|6cfa1b1c-196c-40d4-9c6b-a2126a162ffb}}\n|effect =10% chance to apply [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Terrified|Terrified]] for 8.0 sec on scoring [[Hit]] (excludes [[grazes]])\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =125843a1-7b6d-4259-bf82-d186891ef84a\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =6396b65a-5c03-40ab-a064-e0ad3761c1d7\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =d9cc6f16-0616-4b2a-a246-f4a88522ca12\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=f729a968-d1c3-45f1-b0f4-7430b6204801\n}}\n}}",
