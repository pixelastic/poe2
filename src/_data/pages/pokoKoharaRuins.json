Follow the flags planted in the ground to a pillar covered in Engwithan runes (<i>\"Gods punish trespassers\"</i>). You can find two dried-up skeletons near it - definitely not the VTC you're looking for. Their camp is in the northwestern corner. Note that crossing the space between the two ruined towers will lead to an encounter with a swarm of [sand grub](/sandGrub/)s in quicksand which will slow you down (applying [Slog Zone](/statusEffectsDeadfireSlogZone/)) and can randomly knock over.\n* The camp is abandoned and most of the supplies rotted through. You can interact with the lingering soul for a quick cutscene. The nearby well can be interacted with as part a scripted interaction. A rope was dropped down the ancient well, with nothing attached to it and water on the bottom. You can send someone down the well. A sack of gems is hidden just above the water. [Athletics](/athletics/) 4 allows you to swing towards it and recover it, while [Dexterity](/dexterity/) 12 allows you to recover all the gems intact (8x [Aquamarine](/aquamarine/), 3x [Garnet](/garnetDeadfire/), and 1x [Emerald](/emeraldDeadfire/)).\n* There is a small group of sand blights to the northeast, near a hidden stash containing a few gems. A more interesting spot is to the southeast, with a (large) xaurip camp that has no less than three priests and several champions and skirmishers. The prize is mostly supplies looted from the VTC expedition, and the unique pistol [Thundercrack Pistol](/thundercrackPistol/) in a trapped crate.\n* The oasis in the center holds a pair of [oasis delemgan](/oasisDelemgan/)s and [desert wurm](/desertWurm/)s. The prize is a lovely [desert wurm hatchling](/desertWurmHatchling/).\n* Approaching the facade of the ruin will trigger another cutscene where [Gian](/gian/), [Falero](/falero/), [Olara](/olara/), and [Beza](/beza/) are fleeing something that makes a tremendous amount of noise. Gian's sand-covered body is ripe for the picking, but offers only minor loot. Once you do approach the facade, you will learn just who did him in: An [Engwithan Titan](/engwithanTitan/). It's a particularly challenging fight, especially since sand blights will join the fray once you knock him down to 50% strength.\n* To open the door, you can:<section begin=ruin_entry/>\n** [Copper Muz큰ma Shell Key](/copperMuzumaShellKey/) - Use the key given to you by (or pickpocketed from) [Ranga Ru훮nu](/rangaRuanu/).\n** [Prybar](/prybarDeadfire/) - Raise the door with a prybar.
