  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsBeastOfWinter/) in {{bow}}. It activates automatically after the DLC is activated and the player enters the world map.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nHigh Harbinger [Vatnir](/vatnir/), leader of a [Rymrgand](/rymrgand/) cult out in [The Dead Floe](/theDeadFloe/), has invited the Watcher to a feast in their honor, so that they may honor Rymrgand impending dominion over Eora. The Watcher decides to come.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* The quest is activated by the [wax-sealed letter](/waxSealedLetter/) that's automatically delivered to you once on the world map. If you've just started the game, this occurs after finishing [Stranded](/stranded/) upon leaving [Vilario's Rest](/vilariosRest/) on your ship.\n* To begin, simply head south-east, past the Windless Waste, to the newly-marked [Harbinger's Watch](/harbingersWatch/). After a run-in with an excited Harbinger, proceed to [Harbingers' Retreat](/harbingersRetreat/) in the center of the map.\n* Inside, you are greeted by [Harbinger Valbrendhür](/harbingerValbrendhur/), who gives out a free set of Harbinger robes. Your goal, [Vatnir](/vatnir/), is in the northwest. He will introduce you as the Duskspeaker, allowing you to react in a variety of ways, including a special option for [Clergy](/clergy/) with [Deception](/deception/) 8. \n* Then he will proceed by listing your accomplishments, including a rather, uh, skewed view of the events of {{poe1}}, up to and including pinning the Hollowborn curse on the Watcher. Perfect. You can reply with a special option, [Religion](/religion/) 15, or just go ahead and skip to the feast. Except there shall be no feast, as something called [The Messenger](/theMessenger/) appears in the Watch, leading to Vatnir's cultists tripping over each other on the way out the door.\n* Exit the temple after this peculiar introduction to be introduced to an even more interesting character: A dracolich. After several strafing runs over the village, killing a dozen or so Harbingers - much to their delight - the dragon will land and await your approach. Due to its state, the dragon can't speak - or doesn't want to - and will attack after a short exchange. After dispatching it, head back into the Retreat.\n* Vatnir can be found cowering in his secret room, accessed through his quarters and a hidden switch in the skull. After talking to him, you'll learn that Vatnir basically invented the Messenger as a way to explain the dragon's raids on the Watch - and isn't actually the fanatical zealot he appears to be. He will suggest looking for answers in the [The Rimebound Temple](/theRimeboundTemple/), which the Dead Floe grew around. You can obtain Vatnir as a companion with 12 Deception, 9 Streetwise, 11 Religion or 11 Metaphysics, or tell him that he has to set things right. Either way, [Harbinger Hafjórn](/harbingerHafjorn/) will appear, and after exchanging a couple of perplexed lines with Vatnir, get an untimely promotion to deputy High Harbinger.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX02_01_Iceberg_Dungeon/LAX02_qst_critical_path_quest_01.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''An Honored Guest'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| A <b>letter</b> sealed with the symbol of the god <b>Rymrgand</b> arrived for me.
