Running blockades and evading Vailian customs ships were worthy challenges and Min took great pleasure in constantly pushing her luck. She commanded countless sloops, ketches, and caravels over her career transporting valuable contraband and always insisted on flying her personal colors, which depicted a cat with a mocking grin.\n\nWhen her countless pursuers inevitably caught up to her, it only heightened her thrill. She enjoyed few things as much as honest swashbuckling. To that end she wielded this sabre in many fights and narrow escapes. While she was not overburdened with many personal possessions, she prized the blade, and cared for it lovingly.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1107\n| shop_value        = 5535\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| attack_time       = 1.0\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 9\n| handing           = One-handed\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 17-25\n| damage_type       = Slash\n| weapon_bonuses    = Sharp\n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Long Odds\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sabre_U_Mins_Fortune\n| location          = * [[Old City]]: On a corpse near a circle of Rotghast's corpses in the north, along the shore.\n| guid              = 7ed0c844-f99d-4ffa-8685-5c4430976c19\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sabre}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Fortune's Folly and Lucky Strike are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Fortunes_Folly-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|306c013e-539d-454c-aac6-db3dbd0fbc02}}\n|effect =Random [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Affliction]] for 10.0 sec on [[Crit]]\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =2698426e-c4ee-457b-8d1c-d55823f06c66\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =52d4be66-1b00-44b7-9e0b-c6f99544f126\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =125843a1-7b6d-4259-bf82-d186891ef84a\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Lucky_Strike-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|569821f1-4f45-49ae-a398-802159a328a0}}\n|effect =+15% [[Crit]] damage\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =da73b3da-f763-4a1a-a22a-ee4f0a0d9705\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =991fc9a3-8e0b-48dd-82a0-47e7ae616f60\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =1a3ddb58-d3f8-49e9-ae94-6e3ef08ebd72\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n}}",
