You search for an entrance and finally spy one at the very top of a long staircase.}}\n\nThe Oathbinder's Sanctum is a large temple dedicated to [[Woedica]].\n\n==Points of interest==\n;First floor\n* The entrance area has little in the way of interesting items, save the offering spot. \n;Second floor\n* Another small area. The chamber near the entrance contains a soul of an innocent murdered by Woedica's cultists. Interacting with it and collecting the souls will trigger an ambush by shades. The stairwell below is behind a door activated by a pull-chain to the northwest.\n;Third floor\n* This is a larger area. Immediately by the entrance is a body with a [[bloody note]]. Open the door with the pull-chain and wipe the beetles and grubs in the room beyond. There's [[Peter]] in the corridor to the northwest, behind the bend. The exit to the fourth level is behind another door with a chain.\n;Fourth floor\n* The corridor circumnavigates the area. You can follow the corridor to a room with a black pool (and black oozes if you step in it). Follow the corridor to find a nest of xaurips and an \"ordinary sword\" on the body. \n* The door leads deeper into the pyramid, through a corridor stacked with traps. Disarm and move on. At the end of the corridor is a hidden chamber activated through a hidden brick. The chamber to the south contains rotghasts and more minor loot. The one to the north contains [[Oswald]] and the Steel Garrote.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Oswald]]: An elf abducted by the Steel Garrote.\n* [[Inquisitor Lödwyn]]: Judge in the Court of [[Woedica]], inquisitor of [[the Steel Garrote]].\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Peter]]: Level three, to the northwest.\n* [[Sky Dragon Wurm]]: Level four, north west, in the xaurip nest ({{Legacy|poe1}} only if you did not kill the [[Sky Dragon]] in {{poe1}}, and you had it leave the [[Temple of Hylea]] - instead of letting it stay).\n* [[Watcher's Blade]]: On a body in the xaurip next (looted as [[Ordinary Sword]]).\n\n==Quest==\n* [[Lost Dues in Good Faith]]: If you go here and complete the interaction with Oswald and Iquisitor Lödwyn before picking up the quest, your interaction with [[Kahn]] will be limited to paying, or refuse to pay, Oswald's debt.\n[[Category:Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire dungeons]]",
