Her marriage with her own elf husband was a cold one and produced no children. It was in Lord Edwarth's trueborn son, Matthew, that she found solace. She loved the boy as a son and cared for him after the passing of his mother, Edwarth's true wife.\n\nMatthew desired nothing more than to join the ranks of the knights of Aedyr, like his father, and trained as a squire from a young age. As he grew into a young man, he excelled in martial prowess and Aedyran virtue, eventually earning a command in the colony of the Dyrwood. The young captain became known for his bravery and evenhandedness in his protection of the empire's subjects. Esteemed with her surrogate son's accomplishments, Lethandria commissioned a shield worthy of his station, and Matthew wielded it with pride.\n\nWhen the Dyrwood broke away from the empire, however, Lethandria was horrified to learn Lord Edwarth himself had been dispatched to put down the rebels along the borders. It seemed her precious Matthew had taken up the cause of the Dyrwoodans. After a long and bloody battle, Captain Matthew met his own father in single combat. Matthew's shield, shining in the moonlight, held true, but it was to no avail. The aspiring knight was cut down.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Shield\n| shield_type       = Medium shield\n| item_category     = Shield\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 2407\n| shop_value        = 12036\n| deflection_mod    = 14\n| accuracy_mod      = -4\n| shield_bonuses    = Shield Engagement\n| curr_enchantments = Superb shield (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Hardened Crystal;Pale Light\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Shield_Medium_Heater_U_Lethandrias_Devotion\n| location          = * [[Periki's Overlook]]: Sold by [[Fassina]] in [[The Dark Cupboard]].\n| guid              = 6547ba07-fa7c-41f0-bee5-f48dbcc6f3eb\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Medium shield}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Upgrades ==\n;Note: Nourishing Light / Sheltering Light and Captivating Crystal / Lustrous Crystal are mutually exclusive.\n\n<!--Name:Recipe_Nourishing_Light-->\n{{Pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod ={{pe2mod|5a88bd18-4c15-4663-a3b1-3767e0eaa57c}}\n|effect = +1 Health Restored per 3.0 sec to allies in a 2.5m radius during nighttime (reverts to 6.0 sec during daytime)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =ec090111-cbc3-4da3-8b70-d0c20ae9fb2c\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =c427f61a-e564-4676-891f-2f20ce94f9aa\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =8f39fa64-1f06-42d4-8997-4208ed4278b3\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=2f3f0fc4-3448-418e-83fd-ed6d9cfc84d9\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sheltering_Light-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|922c6532-1931-4306-acb9-8b221686bb6d}}\n|effect = +1 Health Restored per 6.0 sec, +5 All [[Defenses]] except [[Deflection]] to all allies in a 2.5m radius\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =ec090111-cbc3-4da3-8b70-d0c20ae9fb2c\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =598cbf3d-0635-45f3-9034-2c7b2753b4ab\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =9ab39d53-bfba-4afa-841d-2ffb0de132e2\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=2f3f0fc4-3448-418e-83fd-ed6d9cfc84d9\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Captivating_Crystal-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod ={{pe2mod|c45632e9-bd2b-40ba-81fa-a43c7f5bdde4}}\n|effect = Receiving [[Critical Hits]] from Melee Attacks has a 50% chance to cause [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Confused]] on attackers (Upgrades to [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Charmed]] on [[Crit]])\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =b43f6a5c-9627-426c-b605-e6890a16df0b\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =8d94986f-66cd-4b0d-8e30-e2c58aa574fe\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =5a72bd37-59b3-473d-ab2f-a9c44673efa4\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Lustrous_Crystal-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|805ae596-371a-48ff-aeec-ac7ccae0ee54}}\n|effect = 15% resistance against [[Intellect Afflictions|Intellect Affliction]] attacks\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =c78ae47d-60ff-4dbc-8aa3-f4778e7c6f0d\n|q1   =2\n|ing2 =8fecf40c-f616-43bb-9e73-d1c5a2c0aebf\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =125843a1-7b6d-4259-bf82-d186891ef84a\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\nEvery time you switch to a weapon set that contains this shield you will trigger a tick of the healig aura instantly, even if the game is paused.
