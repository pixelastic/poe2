  "markdown": "'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a scripted interaction in {{poe2}}.

Their sweet flesh makes them an ideal catch among whale hunters.\n* Any of the other choices: you learn from one of your crew that the [Huana](/huana/) consider it rare luck to see one surface, as the creature spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea to be \"near the heart of the world.\"\nAs it breaks the surface, you see that its skin is translucent and freckled with phosphorescence, and you can make out the ghostly outlines of luminous organs beneath it.\n* You can ask your crew for their thoughts. With your permission, they could hunt the beast - it's meat would feed the crew for days, and would certainly bring some excitement. Another is appalled that they'd consider killing one of [Ondra](/ondra/)'s harbingers and squander such a blessing.\n* If the Watcher is a [Cipher](/cipher/), you can reach out to the beast's mind. The creature's mind feels intricate, and almost as complex as a kith's. \nUltimately you have two choices here, to let the creature pass in peace, or hunt the creature for its meat. \n* Let the creature pass: It continues alongside your ship for many hours, singing a low, mournful, yet peaceful whale song. As night falls, the beast still follows, its luminescence brings a comforting light in the darkness. By morning, it is gone - though the sense of calm it brought remains. You lose 5 Morale. If [Edér](/eder/) is in the party, you gain positive disposition with him (Animal Kindness). The crew earns 90 experience and 1 Sailor Experience.\n* Take up spears and prepare for a hunt: Your crew lower a skiff from the ship and grab their harpoons. If [Edér](/eder/) is in the party, you gain negative disposition with him (Animal Cruelty).\n** One of your crew leaps from the skiff and drives a harpoon into the beast's flesh, it thrashes and slaps the crew member from its back and into the water, injuring them in the process. With a line from the harpoon attached, it drags the skiff in a wide circle around the ship. Though technically this event requires a Deckhand 3 check, it will occur even if this check fails.\n** With another Deckhand 3 check, your crew eventually wears the beast's strength enough for them to be able to put it out of its misery with a few swift swings of a hatchet. Over the next 18 hours, the beast's corpse is heaved onto the ship and stripped of its rich, fatty meat. Your crew gains 10 Morale, 40x [Mohorā Meat](/mohoraMeat/), 90 experience and 1 Sailor experience.\n** Failing these checks, the creature dives and severs the line, sending the skiff lurching forward. The beast's glow fades as it returns to the depths. Your crew gains 90 experience and 1 Sailor experience, but no morale or resource gain.\n\n## Trivia\n\n* This interaction only appears if you have at least two sailors crewed to your ship.\n* Two other, much more severe variations of this interaction exist in other parts of the Deadfire, which have your crew killed by the beast if the checks fail. Te Hīka Fishing Pools is the most tame of the three variations.\n\n##  Gallery \n\n###### Scripted interaction graphics\n\n<gallery mode=nolines>\n RE si sea monster shadow.png\n RE si whaling.png\n Re si victory.png\n</gallery>",
