Most of the pages are dark brown and stiff, stained with some dark, aromatic beverage.\n\nA few pages have been ripped from the end.\n\n\"We set out at dawn on orders from [[Governor Alvari]]. She's heard rumor of luminous adra at a place called [[Poko Kohara]]. Unfortunately, the place is said to be surrounded by storms, and it doesn't appear on any of our charts, but we're told the locals at [[Tikawara]] may be able to help.\n\n20 Préauton\nI'd heard stories of bad run-ins with Huana tribes, but Chieftain [[Ranga Ruānu|Ruānu]] and the tribe at Tikawara welcomed us warmly. Fed us as well as could be expected and marked Poko Kohara on our maps. He seems to believe the storms are magical, or else the will of the gods. I hold out hope that they can be stopped.\n\n2 Majauton\nLeft for Poko Kohara this morning. [[Vektor]] wasn't happy about being left behind, but he was too sick to travel and [[Beza]] was losing patience. Haven't seen a Rauataian ship since we left Neketaka, but she's still afraid they'll beat us there.\n\n5 Majauton\nStorms were some of the worst I've seen, but we made it. We set up camp by the cliffs, but we're all looking forward to getting into the ruins. At least it'll be dry in there.\n\n7 Majauton\nWe lost [[Gian]] and [[Olara]] today. I don't know what, but something about this place seems off. The others feel it, too.\n\n? Majauton\nThe murals here are incredible - proof that the Engwithans met ancient Huana two thousand years ago! That they might have even built this place! I keep trying to explain this to Beza, but she won't listen.\n\n? Majauton\nWe found the top of the adra vein. It is glowing, but Beza says we have to go deeper.\"\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Journal\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = The Storms of Poko Kohara\n| rel_items      = Beza's Pages\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = ITEM_MISC_Poko_Kohara_VTC_Log\n| guid           = e03e2804-c060-4b8e-bd5f-27c84c3f2074\n| location       = * [[Engwithan Waystation Level Two]]: Found on the body of [[Dueno]].\n}}\n'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[book]] in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Based on the dates, the expedition starts occurs approximately 18 days prior to the revival of the Watcher on ''[[The Defiant]]'', and the start of the game.\n* The log is assumed to be written by [[Falero]], one of the members of the expedition.
