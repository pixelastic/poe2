It was an endless task. A living being would have gone mad from the mental drudgery. As a fampyr, however, Menzzago required only the most minor diversion to retain what remained of his sanity.\n\nHe set aside a tiny portion of his mind and reached out to the innumerable vermin of the Reef. He found kindred spirits in the many spiders skittering about his prison. They were like him, endlessly weaving and maintaining their tiny kingdoms. Also like him, they had a lovely work ethic.\n\nSo he put them to work. Using small fraction of his power, he induced the spiders to weave for him something pretty. Menzzago took great pleasure in how they danced like puppets on gossamer strings. Eventually the spiders produced for him a bolt of beautiful, durable silk.
