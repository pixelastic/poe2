  "markdown": "{{Cleanup|Much of the walkthrough is duplicated across Benweth and non-Benweth routes. Ideally it should be combined into one, with differences noted as needed.}}\n\n'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [faction quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsFactionQuests/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nFurrante has charged Aeldys with having committed crimes of defiance, negligence, excessive cruelty, and sedition against the Príncipi. The Council of Captains has voted to execute Aeldys, however, she is the only one who knows the means for which to summon the Floating Hangman - information Furrante needs before Aeldys can hang.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n[Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/) wants to eliminate [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/) and use her knowledge to seize the [Floating Hangman](/floatingHangman/). He sends you to carry out the execution. He has already secured the consent of the Consuaglo by accusing her of sacrificing a Principi crew to lure out the Floating Hangman. \n\nYou can choose three different outcomes for this quest:\n# Furrante stays leader, Aeldys is dead or exiled.\n# Aeldys becomes leader, Furrante is dead.\n# Both leaders are dead, [Two-Eyed Pim](/twoEyedPim/) (or [One-Eyed Pim](/oneEyedPim/)) becomes leader.<ref>[Talk:Honor_Among_Thieves](/talkHonorAmongThieves/)</ref>\n\nThe steps to get these endings depend on how you dealt with [Benweth](/benweth/) during [Blow the Man Down](/blowTheManDown/). \n\n## =If Benweth is alive\n\n=\n<!-- n_Benweth_State =  6 -->\nEnding 1: Furrante stays leader.\n* Go up to the tower and kill Aeldys. Read her soul and report to Furrante. Note that [Hel Beckoning](/helBeckoning/) will not be lootable from Aeldys' corpse when killing her on the roof. \n* OR: Speak with Aeldys, return to Furrante and tell him to hang her, then read her soul.\n* OR: Convince Aeldys and Furrante to let Aeldys go in exchange for the information. Through the dialogue you can have her offer to take Clussa's Voyage in return for the Hangman's secret. You can convince Furrante make the offer too, before talking to her, using Insight 12 or Intellect 16. \n\nEnding 2: Aeldys becomes leader.\n* Kill Furrante. However, the other Principi will become hostile and attack, resulting in some reputation loss. Go up to the tower and release Aeldys. You can lie to the guard you can avoid a fight if they question you.\n* OR: Loot [A Letter from Director Castol](/aLetterFromDirectorCastol/) in Furrante's office (the southern room in Balefire Beacon). You can easily unlock the chest with a total [Mechanics](/mechanics/) skill of 13 or higher, or you can attempt to pickpocket Furrante for his [key](/oiledIronKey/). Confront him about working with the Vailian Trading Company to sell slaves. Furrante will be hanged and Aeldys freed.\n* OR: Go up to the tower and free Aeldys. All nearby Principi will become hostile. Go back downstairs and kill Furrante and the other hostile Principi. You can loot [Furrante's Breastplate](/furrantesBreastplate/) from Furrante's corpse, and will receive [Scordeo's Edge](/scordeosEdge/) from Aeldys. You'll also loot Benweth's suolenet.\n\nEnding 3: Two-Eyed Pim becomes leader. \n* Go up to the tower and kill Aeldys. Return to Furrante and kill him.\n* OR: Attack Furrante and kill him. Go up to the tower and free Aeldys. Attack/kill Aeldys as soon as you're able to. Pim will stay friendly and won't get maimed.\n* Note that the quest will fail if you take this route, you'll be unable to do [A Dance with Death](/aDanceWithDeath/), but Pim will be leader.\n\nAlternative Ending: One-Eyed Pim becomes leader. \n* Complete this quest, but take a path where Aeldys becomes leader.\n* Accept the following quest, [A Dance with Death](/aDanceWithDeath/). You can work through that quest until obtaining the ghost ship, the [Fonferrus](/fonferrus/).\n* Return to Aeldys. Attack and kill her. The other Principi will become hostile and also attack. Two-Eyed Pim will be among the bodies. However, Pim survives the attack (having lost an eye), becomes [One-Eyed Pim](/oneEyedPim/), and is leader of the Principi.\n\n## =If Benweth was killed\n\n=\n<!-- n_Benweth_State =  9 -->\nEnding 1: Furrante stays leader.\n<!-- n_FQP_Principi_Leader = 1 -->\n* Confront Aeldys in the [Fort Deadlight](/fortDeadlight/) command room. Kill her and take the information you need from her corpse. This yields you the unique sword [Hel Beckoning](/helBeckoning/) as loot, but you'll have to fight your way out of the fort. Return to Furrante.\n\nEnding 2: Aeldys becomes leader.\n<!-- n_FQP_Principi_Leader = 2 -->\n* Kill Furrante outright. However, the other Principi will become hostile and attack, resulting in some reputation loss.\n* OR: Loot [A Letter from Director Castol](/aLetterFromDirectorCastol/) in Furrante's office (the southern room in Balefire Beacon). You can easily unlock the chest with a total [Mechanics](/mechanics/) skill of 13 or higher, or you can attempt to pickpocket Furrante for his [key](/oiledIronKey/). Confront him about working with the Vailian Trading Company to sell slaves. Furrante will be hanged. Return to Aeldys with the news.\n* By way of reward, you receive [Scordeo's Edge](/scordeosEdge/) and [Blackblade's Hood](/blackbladesHood/) from Aeldys. \n\nEnding 3: Two-Eyed Pim becomes leader. \n<!-- n_FQP_Principi_Leader = 3 -->\n* First confront and kill Aeldys in Fort Deadlight. Kill Furrante. You'll have to use the attack button to engage him. The other Principi will become hostile and attack, resulting in some reputation loss.\n* Note that the quest will fail if you take this route, you'll be unable to do [A Dance with Death](/aDanceWithDeath/), but Pim will be leader.\n\nAlternative Ending: One-Eyed Pim becomes leader. \n<!-- n_FQP_Principi_Leader = 4 -->\n* Loot [A Letter from Director Castol](/aLetterFromDirectorCastol/) in Furrante's office and confront him then let him be hanged, or kill him outright.\n* Return to Aeldys and share the news. Finish this quest.\n* Accept the following quest, [A Dance with Death](/aDanceWithDeath/). You can work through that quest until obtaining the ghost ship, the [Fonferrus](/fonferrus/).\n* Return to Aeldys. Attack and kill her. The other Principi will become hostile and also attack. Two-Eyed Pim will be among the bodies. However, Pim survives the attack (having lost an eye), becomes [One-Eyed Pim](/oneEyedPim/), and is leader of the Principi.\n\n## Choosing the leader\n\nRelevant dialogue to help you decide which leader you'd rather support.\n\n'''Furrante's vision for Ukaizo and the Principi, respectively:'''\n* \"We will keep it from the hands of others for one. We will settle it, plunder its endless resources, and enjoy having a place to call home.\n* \"Riches and wealth, incomparable to what we have had before.

We live free, and we die as we choose. What better life could there be? If we've only got the one life to live - no future for Eora, no more chances for our souls - then we may as well relish what time we've got.\"\n\n'''Two-Eyed Pim:'''\n<br/>Sadly, he only receives an end-game slide in the Huana control Ukaizo, but his focus is solely on trade.\n\n'''One-Eyed Pim:'''\n<br/>Maimed Pim won't be a very effective leader and seemingly won't become trade focused if the Huana control Ukaizo (no slide will play).\n\n## Notes\n\n* If Aeldys or Furrante is hanged, their loot ([Hel Beckoning](/helBeckoning/) and [Furrante's Breastplate](/furrantesBreastplate/) respectively) will be found on the table to the right or left of Furrante's seat in [Balefire Beacon](/balefireBeacon/).\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_Principi_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_Principi_Betrayal.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Honor Among Thieves'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Furrante</b> has charged <b>Aeldys</b> with having committed crimes of defiance, negligence, excessive cruelty, and sedition against the <b>Príncipi</b>. <b>The Council of Captains</b> has voted to execute Aeldys, however, she is the only one who knows the means for which to summon the <b>Floating Hangman</b> - information Furrante needs before Aeldys can hang.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| <b>Furrante</b> and <b>Aeldys'</b> differences have come to a head, and Furrante has asked that she answer for her crimes against the <b>Príncipi</b>, sending me as his executioner.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40003\n| I've received a letter from <b>Furrante</b>.
