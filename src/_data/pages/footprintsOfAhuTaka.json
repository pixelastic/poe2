He chose a life of self-imposed exile, wandering the lands of Eora to heal the sick. He would aid anyone in need with no regard for their allegiances or past deeds. Shunned by the aristocracy and elites wherever he went, Ahu Taka ministered in the slums and brothels. He passed no judgment and offered only peace and acceptance. He was often observed after battles tending to the wounded and comforting the dying on both sides.\n\nThis eventually drew the ire of a victorious commander. If the vagabond priest wanted to preach to whores and degenerates, that was fine, but healing the commander's enemies was a step too far. The commander ordered his troops to execute the meddling priest where he stood. When none of his men proved willing to carry out the order, the commander drew his own blade and struck Ahu Taka down. According to legend, Ahu Taka used his dying breath to offer his killer forgiveness.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Feet\n| item_type      = Boots\n| item_category  = Accessory\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 2100\n| shop_value     = 10500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = Divine Inspiration;Graceful Motion;Path of Mercy\n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Boots_U_Footprints_of_Ahu_Taka\n| location       = * Scripted event in [[Whēnura Cleft]] at 8° 4' S, 56° 56' E. \n| guid           = 4f53863d-ab31-4bf0-8460-9077b3b69960\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a pair of [[Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire accessories#Boots|boots]] in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
