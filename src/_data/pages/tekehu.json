He has a wealth of magical talent, good training, and unfortunately, not a whole lot of humility. As such, he constantly gets on the nerves of [Guildmaster Mairu](/guildmasterMairu/) with his antics, like trying to get to the Palace without an appointment and especially skipping lectures. It is a natural result of a life without friction or challenge resulting from his status and prominence among the Huana. [Ondra](/ondra/) would have the Watcher provide him with guidance, to realize his natural potential and find the strength within.\n\nTekehu belongs to the Kahanga tribe, the most powerful of Huana tribes and the one currently at the helm of the tribal confederation. His particular people come from Etūa, a small island not marked on any map. Although he considers Ngati to be his true mother, he remembers his biological parents. His mother tans boar hides, while the father trades in pearls and opals available on their island in abundance. His birth was accompanied by a terrific storm that tore through the village and only stopped when he made it to the midwife's basket. His childhood was filled with swimming and learning from his father how to dive for pearls and azata snails. His coming of age coincided with the intensifying efforts by Rauatai and the Republics to subjugate the Deadfire Archipelago. As Ngati's chosen, Tekehu was considered an omen to all of Huana and fast-tracked into the Watershapers Guild.\n\nHe continued his education and training since then, though royal favor and reverence shown him in early life coalesced into the kind of arrogant personality that grates on the nerves of pretty much every other Watershaper.\n\n## Interactions\n\n{{Interactions\n|companion       = x\n|wares           =\n|stronghold      =\n|rest            =\n|quests_started  =\n|quests_involved = [Trade Secrets](/tradeSecrets/)<br/>[The Shadow Under Neketaka](/theShadowUnderNeketaka/)\n|other           =\n|none            = \n}}\n\n## =Quests\n\n=\n* [Trade Secrets](/tradeSecrets/): Tekēhu believes some water shapers are exhibiting suspicious behavior. \n* [The Shadow Under Neketaka](/theShadowUnderNeketaka/): Tekēhu features heavily in the quest as his belief in the Guild is shaken.\n\n## =Companion\n\n=\n* Tekēhu can be recruited at the [Watershapers Guild](/watershapersGuild/), after he's chewed out by the Guildmaster for skipping a lecture.\n* Tekēhu will leave permanently if the player sides with the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/) during [The Coming Storm](/theComingStorm/).\n\n###### Class\n\n*The class options available to Tekēhu are the [chanter](/chanter/) subclass [Stormspeaker](/chanterStormspeaker/), the [druid](/druid/) subclass [Watershaper](/druidWatershaper/), or a [multiclass](/multiclass/) of the two (Theurge). \n**[Stormspeaker](/chanterStormspeaker/) is Tekēhu's unique chanter subclass, which gains a selection of elemental invocations, but loses access to Summon invocations.\n**[Watershaper](/druidWatershaper/) is Tekēhu's unique druid subclass, which gains a selection of water-based spells (including foe-only versions of AoE Frost spells) but loses access to Fire and Creature druid spells.
