These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.\n\nIt is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.\n\nThough all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Minoletta's Minor Missiles (Deadfire);Thrust of Tattered Veils (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Necrotic Lance (Deadfire);Fetid Caress (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Fireball (Deadfire);Minoletta's Bounding Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Maura's Writhing Tentacles (Deadfire);Minoletta's Concussive Missiles (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Form of the Helpless Beast (Deadfire);Malignant Cloud (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire);Chain Lightning (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Delayed Fireball (Deadfire);Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Kalakoth's Freezing Rake (Deadfire);Wilting Wind (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Meteor Shower;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire04\n| location       = * Dropped by Spellblade in [[Secret Dock]] in [[Fort Deadlight]] during [[Blow the Man Down]] if you take [[Lamond]]'s path to confronting [[Benweth]].\n* Dropped by Spellblade in [[Benweth]]'s [[Deadlight Donjon|command center]] in [[Fort Deadlight]] during [[Blow the Man Down]].\n| guid           = 234c5112-46b4-475a-b045-205ca17409ad\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
