He didn't have anything against the captain personally. She had rescued him from the abandoned atoll after his old crew deposed him, after all. She had even brought him on as a deckhand. She was a proper pirate - Scordeo just wasn't suited to life as a deckhand. He was a captain, after all, and a captain needed a ship to command.\n\nHe was practiced at mutiny. He gathered a small group of dissatisfied collaborators from among the crew and confronted the captain as she stood at the helm. First he disarmed her. He had had his eye on her sabre for a while. Then he offered her a choice - relinquish command or die. The captain, dumbfounded, was unable to say anything. Scordeo shot her dead. Once again, he found himself in command. Ever generous, he elevated his chief collaborator, a young pirate by the name of Aeldys, to first mate. She was ruthless and ambitious, but surely loyal to him - or so he thought.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sabre\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 3007\n| shop_value        = 15035\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 10\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 20-29\n| damage_type       = Slash\n| weapon_bonuses    = Sharp\n| curr_enchantments = Superb weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Highwayman;Double Strike\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = Scordeo's Trophy\n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sabre_U_Scordeos_Edge\n| location          = * Given to the player by [[Captain Aeldys]] in [[Fort Deadlight]], as a reward for siding with her during the quest [[Honor Among Thieves]].\n| guid              = d3f774cb-0bd6-4dd3-b07a-6377496b865a\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sabre}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Upgrades ==\n;Note: Blade Cascade / Tempest and Adaptive / Strategic Shot are mutually exclusive.\n{{Pe2crafttable|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Scordeos_Edge_Blade_Cascade-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|c31fceeb-d3f7-4ede-957a-a109c44297f7}}\n|effect =5% chance to ignore Recovery for 5.0 sec on scoring Hit\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =b43f6a5c-9627-426c-b605-e6890a16df0b\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =f163ffbf-9539-4e6e-ab78-33fb5519066e\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =a10541f0-c4f2-44dc-8300-f8b13ed615df\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =fe180400-1bc9-4ed2-a680-5f6a72fb96c0\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =7a2cb41b-5d42-4b83-92b4-5577a5ccfc66\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Scordeos_Edge_Tempest-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|6432b81c-f099-4f33-9a6a-72fa62e9c9a8}}\n|effect =10% chance to Recovery instantly on scoring Hit\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =4856e836-930e-470e-be3f-bb6ea7bc58ed\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =cef02c6b-ac11-4a9c-a6ae-fd90de22d543\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =598cbf3d-0635-45f3-9034-2c7b2753b4ab\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =6c41496b-4cab-47b7-b5f1-34e2929109e8\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =7a2cb41b-5d42-4b83-92b4-5577a5ccfc66\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Scordeos_Edge_Adaptive-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|0100da97-921c-4de5-941a-e942de49137b}}\n|effect =+2 [[Accuracy]] with all weapons for 30.0 sec on scoring Hit (stacks 10 times)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =8d94986f-66cd-4b0d-8e30-e2c58aa574fe\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =3578b952-1f1e-42cc-ba73-fd655034c368\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =1c946536-8bf0-468a-840f-f22c089cebaa\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =735bd29f-eb74-4139-8c87-70e2c5f8df98\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =f1ac7991-3e6a-40dd-a67e-4eb7af7cc4dc\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Scordeos_Edge_Strategic_Shot-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|b33ded00-f456-4fe0-8485-048bb6430465}}\n|effect =+3 [[Accuracy]] with Ranged weapons for 30.0 sec on scoring Hit (stacks 10 times)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =88b6a5f3-65c5-49f2-bd8a-49d8bc792645\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =1c767eb4-8aed-42ba-96f4-1c6d34e03c08\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =a4008698-e3e6-4113-b33d-64bdb6269416\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed =f1ac7991-3e6a-40dd-a67e-4eb7af7cc4dc\n}}\n}}",
