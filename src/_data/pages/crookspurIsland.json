You can search the surrounding area with Survival to earn a free rest or identify it with Religion 15. It's dedicated to Rikuhu and earns you a free rest. If you do so, you will be ambushed by a number of slavers. You can use Diplomacy, Intimidation, pay 2000 cp, or use a Priest of Berath background to get out of it peacefully - or kill them all.\n* [50px](/fileIconCampPng/) '''[Silent Dhrwgas](/silentDhrwgas/)''': Location for the bounty.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [50px](/fileIconOldBattlegroundPng/) '''Old Battleground''': Random loot.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n\n###### Northern half\n\n* [50px](/fileIconCrookspurPng/) '''[Crookspur](/crookspur/)''' proper is here.
