By combining coper plates and other conductive elements, Deltro hoped to divert any incoming electricity away and disperse it into the surrounding air. His experiments were a failure. The armor, rather than harmlessly redirecting the electricity, instead caused violent lighting storms. Its construction was costly and the resulting piece, while beautiful, would never fulfill its purpose. It was instead gifted to a high ranking Bardatto family member as stood as decoration for many years.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Armor\n| armor_type        = Plate armor\n| armor_category    = Heavy armor\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1140\n| shop_value        = 5700\n| recovery_speed    = +55%\n| dr_base           = 11\n| dr_crush          = 7\n| dr_pierce         = \n| dr_slash          = \n| dr_burn           = \n| dr_corrode        = \n| dr_freeze         = \n| dr_shock          = 7\n| armor_bonuses     = \n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional armor (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Dynamo\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Plate_Armor_U_Deltros_Cage\n| guid              = 2630c25a-9efa-420e-8d16-d0fc9b190aa2\n| location          = * Worn by [[Ezzali Bardatto]] and can be obtained if you side with House Valeras and kill the Bardatto family.\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Plate armor}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Conductive Storm and Shock Shield are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=2|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Deltros_Cage_Conductive_Storm-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|722e23de-4af8-4eb4-bd82-a473555e9ab9}}\n|effect =Grants [[Relentless Storm (Deadfire)|Relentless Storm]]: Foe AoE: 7-10 {{shock}}, [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Afflictions|Stunned]] for 2.0 sec\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =c78ae47d-60ff-4dbc-8aa3-f4778e7c6f0d\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =1c767eb4-8aed-42ba-96f4-1c6d34e03c08\n|q2   =2\n|ing3 =\n|q3   =\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Deltros_Cage_Shock_Shield-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|11d0c15b-c166-4921-85b7-a688f55cd38b}}\n|effect =Shock Damage heals for 50% instead of dealing damage with Electricity attacks.
