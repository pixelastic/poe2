He wants to know how it is being supplied. Someone in the Gullet ought to know a way to Delver's Row. Showing the prince's medallion might attract the attention of a prospective buyer in the black market.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Talk to the Prince to begin the quest. He gives you [The Envoy's Badge](/theEnvoysBadge/), a token of Vailian dignitary. It can be used in a couple of different instances:\n** To get information from [Fyrna](/fyrna/) in [The Hole](/theHole/) regarding the location of [Delver's Row](/delversRow/).\n** By showing it to [Ernezzo](/ernezzo/), a Vailian shopkeeper in Delver's Row, you can be granted free passage to [Dereo's Lair](/dereosLair/).\n* This quest is intertwined with [Delver's Row (quest)](/delversRowQuest/). Reaching the Row will update it automatically, while realizing that the Roparu are smuggling goods into [the Gullet](/theGullet/) through the [Undercroft](/undercroft/) provides you with information for the Prince.\n* Gain access to the [Undercroft](/undercroft/) by starting [The Cornett's Call](/theCornettsCall/) for [Dereo](/dereoTheLean/). After completing the first part of the quest and retrieving the [Cornett of Waves](/cornettOfWaves/), Dereo will grant you passage down via the lift in Delver's Row. Alternatively you can kill the lift guards and force your way through.\n* Upon entering the Undercroft, you learn that the [Principi](/principiSenPatrena/) pirates are smuggling goods via the lower city with the help of the [Watershapers](/watershapersGuildFaction/). Return to the Prince to report your findings.\n** With [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 3, you can convince the Prince to leave Delver's Row alone, in order to keep the Roparu happier.\n** When you reveal the involvement of the Watershapers, you can also use [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 6 to suggest better funding for the Guild to prevent them from seeking opportunities like this one.\n{{-}}\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_Huana_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_01_Black_Market.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Trade Secrets'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Prince Aruihi</b> has discovered evidence of a black market in the Roparu district of the city known as the <b>Gullet.</b> He wants to know how it is being supplied. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Locate <b>Delver's Row.</b>'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| Someone in the <b>Gullet</b> ought to know a way to <b>Delver's Row.</b> Showing the prince's medallion might attract the attention of a prospective buyer in the black market. \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20002\n| I gained access to <b>Delver's Row</b> through the <b>Narrows</b> in the Gullet, where it was hidden behind a merchant stall.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20003\n| <b>Dereo the Lean</b> sounds like the authority in <b>Delver's Row.</b> Getting closer to him might help me understand how the black market functions.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20010\n| I've learned that <b>Delver's Row</b> is located somewhere in the <b>Narrows</b> - a tunnel system in the west of <b>the Gullet.</b>\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20016\n| To find <b>Delver's Row</b> I need to enter the <b>Narrows,</b> turn right, then continue forward until I see the merchant stall.
