The first island is in the southern part of [Karatapu Channel](/karatapuChannel/) and requires you to explore the [Cavern of Xaur Tuk-Tuk](/cavernOfXaurTukTuk/). The other is south in [Kangati Islands](/kangatiIslands/) and will complete once you complete [Temple of Tangaloa ruins](/templeOfTangaloaRuins/).\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/03_Neketaka_Vailian_District/03_QST_Cartographer_One.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Mapping the Archipelago: Port Maje'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Sanza</b>, the excitable cartographer I met in <b>Queen's Berth</b>, wants to compile a complete guide to the islands of the Deadfire, but he can't do it on his own.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Explore the uncharted islands around <b>Port Maje</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Sanza, the cartographer in Queen's Berth, asked me to make a survey of the uncharted islands of the Deadfire Archipelago.\n\nHe suggested I begin with the two uncharted islands to the north and south of <b>Port Maje</b>.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20000\n| I discovered an <b>island</b> inhabited by a clan of <b>xaurips</b>.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 20001\n| I came across an <b>island</b> of <b>castaways</b>, driven to cannibalism and madness by their hunger.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Return to <b>Sanza</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| I have charted both of the islands in this region. <b>Sanza</b> will want an update on my progress - and the opportunity to fill out his charts.
