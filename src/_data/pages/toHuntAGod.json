Any chance of catching up to him relies on finding some hint of his presence on the island.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This is a large quest spanning most of the first part of the game. It keeps track of all the clues you have regarding Eothas' location.\n* The first step towards finding Eothas is exploring [Port Maje Island](/portMajeIsland/) and reaching [Port Maje](/portMaje/) to obtain information from [Governor Clario](/governorClario/). The governor will request information regarding his adra operations at the [Engwithan Digsite](/engwithanDigsite/), while also revealing that several witnesses reported him heading towards the digsite.\n* The quest is completed together with [Stranded](/stranded/). When you commune with Eothas at the dead adra pillar at the [arena sub-level](/arenaSubLevel/), you automatically complete the quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/Crit_Path/CP_QST_09_To_Hunt_A_God.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''To Hunt a God'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| In the aftermath of the storm, <b>Eothas'</b> trail threatens to grow cold.
