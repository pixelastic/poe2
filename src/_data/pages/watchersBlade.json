No smith has ever claimed responsibility for its forging. Its metal is as smoky and indistinct as the In-Between, with no marking to suggest it has ever felt the kiss of a hammer - leaving many to believe that it assumed this form naturally.\n\nArtfully infused with soul essence, the blade glows in a kinship response to those on familiar terms with death. Its uncanny balance is linked to its ethereal nature, as the blade never seems wholly present in tangible reality. At times it feels like less of a sword than an ideal expression of one, which is why many have mistaken its true nature. Compounding its mystery, ancient war epics have described mauls or daggers with the elusive properties of the Watcher's Blade. This has led some mystics to conclude that the sword is merely a sword in its current and unknowably long \"lifetime,\" and that it could be something else entirely on the next turning of the Wheel.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sword\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 557\n| shop_value        = 2785\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 7\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 15-22\n| damage_type       = Slash;Pierce\n| weapon_bonuses    = \n| curr_enchantments = Fine weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Fine;Soul Severing\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = Ordinary Sword\n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sword_U_Watchers_Sword\n| location          = * [[Oathbinder's Sanctum]]: Gained by examining the [[Ordinary Sword]] found in the Xaurip nest.\n| guid              = 9ba074d4-10e3-4809-b63e-41b9f2499e2c\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Sword}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n;Note: Deny the Wheel and Soul Shredding are mutually exclusive.\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Deny_the_Wheel-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|8db7c32d-5d00-4dd0-8231-ddc8e70705d1}}\n|effect =Killing a [[Kith]] enemy spawns a Shadow for 15.0 sec\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =4856e836-930e-470e-be3f-bb6ea7bc58ed\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =e474463c-1c74-44c5-945c-385d864b6974\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =31ca6dd6-8295-405c-b68a-c0b5636ba6bb\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Soul_Shredding-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|d0ed5885-01be-45fb-bfa5-7d443de3120c}}\n|effect =+20% Damage dealt as [[Raw]]\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =4856e836-930e-470e-be3f-bb6ea7bc58ed\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =ca89dd63-3824-4f74-82b1-fd51796056f3\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =2410e9fd-f3fb-47b2-8e83-9807894db908\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =\n|q4   =\n|ing5 =\n|q5   =\n|removed=a376caa1-d47b-466c-a20f-278528c2df03\n}}\n}}",
