He is likely somewhere in Queen's Berth. Nera wants him found and returned to the Bardatto estate as soon as possible. \n\n## Walkthrough\n\n######  Find Larro\n\n* [Larro Bardatto](/larroBardatto/) is found under the waterfall, engaged in a duel with [Orso Valera](/orsoValera/). As this falls squarely under the category of what Nera would call \"trouble\", you should intervene. The quest is the first of several revealing the feud between the families. You have three options:\n*# Allow the duel to continue, resulting in the death of one of two participants. Without your intervention, Orso will kill Larro. Note that you can bet ten copper on one of the participants at the cost of minor negative reputation with [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/). \n*# Break up the duel and chase the group away at the cost of minor negative reputation with [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/):\n*#* [Might](/might/) 18.\n*#* [Bluff](/bluff/) 5 - [Resourcefulness](/resourcefulness/).\n*#* [Resolve](/resolve/) 16 or ask if this is worth dying over, then threaten them with [Bluff](/bluff/) 3 - [Skulduggery](/skulduggery/) that you'll suck their souls into the beyond.\n*# Propose an alternative with [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 3. Fighting to the first blood satisfies all parties.\n* Note that these dialogs will lose you minor reputation with [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/):\n** \"You don't have to do this, you know.\"\n** [Resolve](/resolve/) 16 - [Autonomy](/autonomy/).\n\n######  Observe the duel\n\nIn the case the confrontation results in a fight, you enter a scripted interaction. The skill checks during the duel are [Watcher](/watcher/)-only without [Party assist](/partyAssist/).\n* Before the duel start, you can:\n** Simply watch the duel to its end.\n** Bless one of the participants if you're playing a priest.\n** Find a better vantage point with [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 2. This allows you to trip the participants.\n** Study the opponents with [Insight](/insight/) 2.\n* During the fight, you can assist either of the participants by insulting ([Insight](/insight/) 2) or tripping their opponent (requires previously finding a better vantage point).\n* If it's a fight to the death.\n** Without your intervention, Orso will win.\n** Assisting Larro lets him win.\n* If it's a fight to first-blood.\n** If you assist Larro, Larro will succeed in disarming Orso. At this point, Larro will normally win, but if you shout something, Larro will do as you say. Kicking the sword back to Orso ([Athletics](/athletics/) 2) will reverse the situation and Orso ends up killing Larro.\n** Otherwise, Orso will succeed in disarming Larro. Orso, however, gets careless which leads to Larro killing Orso in a moment of desperation. If you intervene, Orso will normally win.\n* For each intervention during the duel, you lose minor reputation with [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/).\n* Intervening to stop the first-blood duel from ending in death does not cause a reputation loss.\n* If no one dies, you gain minor reputation with [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/).\n\n######  Get your rewards\n\n* If Larro lives, go back to the [Bardatto Estate](/bardattoEstate/) and talk to [Nera Bardatto](/neraBardatto/) to claim your reward: {{cp2|800}} or {{cp2|1000}} if you say you didn't do it for charity.\n* If you assisted Larro during the scripted interaction (either by making him win, or try to stop Orso from killing Larro with [Wizard](/wizard/)/[Paladin](/paladin/)/[Priest](/priest/) or [Resolve](/resolve/) 4), talk to [Ezzali Bardatto](/ezzaliBardatto/) to get a bonus of {{cp2|1000}}.\n** Talking further with Ezzali will lead to the quests [Family Pride](/familyPride/) and [A Sinking Feeling](/aSinkingFeeling/).\n\n## Gallery\n\n###### Scripted interaction graphics\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\n 03 si the duel unarmed.png\n 03 si the duel start.png\n 03 si the duel clashing.png\n 03 si the duel sword slash.png\n 03 si the duel defeated.png\n 03 si the duel death.png\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/03_Neketaka_Vailian_District/03_TSK_The_Duel.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Salt in the Wound'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Nera Bardatto</b> is worried that her younger brother, <b>Larro</b>, might be getting himself into trouble. \n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| Two young men of the <b>Bardatto</b> and <b>Valera</b> families appear to have chosen the waterfall above <b>Queen's Berth's adra mill</b> as the site for a duel.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Find <b>Larro Bardatto</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Nera told me that her younger brother, <b>Larro</b>, missed an appointment.
