The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Thrust of Tattered Veils (Deadfire);Slicken (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Grimoire Slam (Deadfire);Necrotic Lance (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Expose Vulnerabilities (Deadfire);Arcane Dampener (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Minoletta's Concussive Missiles (Deadfire);Minor Arcane Reflection (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Call to Slumber (Deadfire);Form of the Helpless Beast (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Gaze of the Adragan (Deadfire);Arcane Reflection (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Tayn's Chaotic Orb (Deadfire);Llengrath's Warding Staff (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Temporal Cocoon;Minoletta's Piercing Sigil (Deadfire)\n| level9_spells  = Arcane Cleanse;Llengrath's Reflection\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Disruption\n| location       = * [[Tikawara]]: Sold by [[Vektor]], at the Tikawara Trading Post.\n| guid           = 6afa73d2-b22d-4b78-8c31-ee6e283fe19a\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
