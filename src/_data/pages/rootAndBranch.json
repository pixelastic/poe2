  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTheForgottenSanctum/) in {{lax3}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nScattered across Wael's temple are copies of the Annals of [Llengrath](/llengrath/), penned by the various incarnations of the archmage. To learn the complete story of the mage and his philosophy, the Watcher has to collect all five.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This is a collection quest tied to the great archmage.  [The Annals of Llengrath, Volume I of V](/theAnnalsOfLlengrathVolumeIOfV/) is collected from the first felled infested librarian and each book collected will allow you to commune with the spirit of that respective Llengrath. The other copies are located: \n** II: [Quarantined Section](/quarantinedSection/), northeastern chamber with the infested librarians and dank spores.\n** III: Quarantined Section, southwestern chamber.\n** IV: Quarantined Section, northwestern chamber, opposite the one with the giant luminescent spore.\n** V: Quarantined Section, behind the giant spore that loves you a little too much.\n* Deliver the whole package over to [Llengrath](/llengrath/) back in the Temple of Revelation. You can give them to [Tayn](/tayn/), who will turn the unmodified memories of the original Llengrath into something he considers a bit more dramatic and interesting, to give Llen some food for thought. Even if you give them to him, you can demand the unmodified version back.\n** Note: The dialog to hand the tomes to Tayn may become unavailable if done after completing [The Inner Mysteries](/theInnerMysteries/). To hand him over the books, first show the books to Llengrath, then use the option \"Tayn would love to see these books\". The option to give Tayn the books should become available in his dialog.\n* Completing the quest will increment favor with one of the mages, depending on completion. This counts towards [The Seeds of Deception](/theSeedsOfDeception/) quest.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/LAX03_Forgotten_Sanctum/lax03_qst_03_llengrath_01.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Root and Branch'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| While exploring the <b>Archives</b>, I found an unsual book called 'The Annals of Llengrath.'\n\nThe book's title suggests there are five volumes in total.
