The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.\n\nAloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Grimoire/trinket\n| item_type      = Grimoire\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = [[Wizard]]\n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 100\n| shop_value     = 500\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = Jolting Touch (Deadfire);Wizard's Double (Deadfire)\n| level2_spells  = Bulwark Against The Elements (Deadfire);Fetid Caress (Deadfire)\n| level3_spells  = Expose Vulnerabilities (Deadfire);Arduous Delay of Motion (Deadfire)\n| level4_spells  = Flame Shield (Deadfire);Confusion (Deadfire)\n| level5_spells  = Blast of Frost (Deadfire);Call to Slumber (Deadfire)\n| level6_spells  = Arcane Reflection (Deadfire);Chain Lightning (Deadfire)\n| level7_spells  = Arcane Reflection (Deadfire);Wall of Draining (Deadfire)\n| level8_spells  = Minoletta's Piercing Sigil (Deadfire);Temporal Cocoon\n| level9_spells  = Petrification;Cloak of Death\n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Grimoire_Fampyr_Ancient_Sage\n| location       = * Dropped by Ancient Fampyr Sage in [[Fampyr's Crypt]], west of [[Razai Passage]] in the NW section of the map.\n| guid           = 8a4b5da4-0f03-4524-956d-33aca175b351\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Grimoire}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
