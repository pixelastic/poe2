  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [task](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTasks/) in {{poe2}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nWhen you enter the Gullet, you witness what looks like an execution - a man was dragged into a cage and lowered into a deep ravine. Before he disappeared he called to a woman named Biha. You can help her - if you want.\n\n## Overview\n\n# Gain access to the [Old City Overlook](/oldCityOverlook/) (via [Overseer Hitenga](/overseerHitenga/)) and talk to [Botaro](/botaro/)'s spirit.\n# Find his stash of coins in a hidden container outside [The Hole](/theHole/).\n# Obtain passage for [Biha](/biha/) and her family by talking to the Rauatai Captain [Sedūzo](/seduzo/), in the Hole.\n# Head upstairs and find a way to secure passage for the other 3 family members by convincing [Orron](/orron/) to give up his reservation.\n# Return to Biha to complete the quest.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* As you witness the execution, [Botaro](/botaro/) will call out to [Biha](/biha/). Following her to her hut allows you to talk to her and find out what Botaro did ([Insight](/insight/) 2 helps to calm her down) and what can be done. It seems that Botaro, Biha, and their children were planning to flee Deadfire for Rauatai, after working on the Brass Citadel and hearing the promise of equality given by the Empire. Problem is, when Botaro went to talk to a Rauataian captain in the slums tavern, he was immediately seized by the Mataru and condemned to the Old City.\n* The Rauataian captain is named [Sedūzo](/seduzo/) and remains at the slums tavern. Biha believes Sedūzo could take her and the children to Rauatai, but after what happened to Botaro, she's hesitant to approach the woman on her own. She also doesn't have any money, as Botaro was carrying it with himself. She will suggest finding him in the Old City.\n* To gain access to the Old City, talk to [Overseer Hitenga](/overseerHitenga/) - who will question your sanity upon asking for access, but will agree if you convince him with either\n** {{cp2|200}}.\n** [History](/history/) 3 - tell him that you want to explore Neketaka's rich history.\n** [Survival](/survival/) 5 - tell him that you can look after yourself.\n* Botaro's body is located just west from the cage drop-off point, savaged by claws and fangs. After dealing with the Dargul's in the area, you can interact with the soul to realize that Botaro was actually a pawn used by [Dereo the Lean](/dereoTheLean/) (operating out of the Delver's Den, through the Narrows) and Botaro was supposed to meet a woman for a package at the adra mill in Queen's Berth - but instead tried to buy himself and his family passage, hiding the money in rubble near the tavern. If you have [Xoti](/xoti/) in your party, she will harvest Botaro's soul to advance [The Lantern of Gaun](/theLanternOfGaun/).\n* At this point you can grab the {{cp2|600}} from a hidden stash just outside [The Hole](/theHole/). Although Biha will refuse to take the coin out of fear of suspicion, offering it to her will get you Minor Positive Reputation with The Gullet. Additionally, letting her know of Botaro's fate will net you further minor rep. Later on, you can also offer to return the coin to [Dereo the Lean](/dereoTheLean/) - though he also will refuse, as a prideful crime lord this time - which will get you Minor Positive Reputation with Delver's Row Criminals\n* Next, you'll have to obtain passage for Biha and her family. Enter the tavern and speak to captain [Sedūzo](/seduzo/) (make sure to bring either [Maia](/maia/), [Serafen](/serafen/), or [Tekehu](/tekehu/) for some fun dialogue). The captain will explain that Botaro threatened her after trying to buy passage with suonelets, marked coins that represent tokens of allegiance among the [Príncipi](/principiSenPatrena/). She believed that she was dealing with a pirate, so she called for the guards. However, slums are an odd place for a trader...\n** You can use [Streetwise](/streetwise/) 4 to accuse her of dealing illegally, [Insight](/insight/) 3 to point out that the RDC likely doesn't know of her presence, and [History](/history/) 2 to ask why doesn't she operate out of the Brass Citadel. Then you can threaten to snitch on her, unless she takes Biha and her children on board. That will secure passage for three.\n** Alternatively, you can be respectful, and tell her that \"...they have little here, Think of how they could benefit from Rauataian culture\".\n* To secure passage for all six, you'll need to deal with [Orron](/orron/) on the upper floor. Orron and his [Goldpact Knights](/goldpactKnights/) have already reserved the berths, leaving no more room for the rest of Biha's family.\n** If you've already convinced the captain into taking three people, and have [Intellect](/intellect/) 14 or higher, you can play on Orron's love of symmetry and get him to change to another ship, allowing Biha to take all the children.\n** Otherwise, you can pay him {{cp2|1200}} ({{cp2|1000}} with [Diplomacy](/diplomacy/) 5) to make up for the inconvenience.\n** As a more aggressive measure, you can also just cut Orron and the mercenaries down to ensure they don't make it to the boat. As a bit of fun, Orron can be antagonized by \"disrupting\" his arrangement of cups, inciting a collective gasp from the mercenaries. Doing it again will cause him to attack.\n** With [Bluff](/bluff/) 4, you can tell him that someone is downstairs with a message for him regarding the adra mill. This will cause him to leave the area and meander about on the first floor (he doesn't come back until you go downstairs).\n*:It's likely this was once used as another option during development, such as poisoning his meal or otherwise luring him to his death (via [Rust](/rust/) below perhaps) - however it seems that the only reason to do this is is to make combat a bit easier by reducing the amount of enemies you'll have to fight at once.\n* Return to Biha. She will be exhilarated if you manage to secure passage for all six, otherwise, she will be forced to make a hard decision. You can suggest that she leave for Rauatai with the infants, send the older ones, or allow her to make the decision. With [Aloth](/aloth/) in the party, allowing her to make the decision will gain positive reputation with Aloth ([Autonomy](/autonomy/)).\n\n## Trivia\n\n* One of the possible options to get rid of Orron may have been to get [Rust](/rust/) to assassinate him and his knights (as seen in journal entry 20005), though Rust does not currently have the dialogue to initiate this. A few other quests in [The Gullet](/theGullet/) have objectives that can be completed with the help of Rust.\n* Although marked as a task, this quest has more content and objectives than some side quests.\n* Some journal entries are duplicated across objectives.\n\n## Gallery\n\n###### Botaro being lowered into the abyss\n\n<gallery mode=\"inline\">\n 06 SI Old City Lift 01.png\n 06 SI Old City Lift Down 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/06_Neketaka_Slums_District/06_TSK_All_Aboard.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''All Aboard'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| I witnessed what looked like an execution - a man was dragged into a cage and lowered into a deep ravine.
