They need the help of the Watcher to find a wizard and someone to play the role of [Eothas](/eothas/).\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n'''Find talented performers for the Pegleg Troupe in [Radiant Court](/radiantCourt/):'''\n* The Wizard, [Taerna](/taerna/), can be found in [The King's Coffin](/theKingsCoffin/). She's willing to join the play, but owes 700 pires to the tavern owner, [Jacob Harker](/jacobHarker/).  You'll have to convince him to release [Taerna](/taerna/) from her servitude with Intimidate 8 or Diplomacy 10, as well as pay her debt of 700 copper (otherwise it's 1400 copper, as he is unwilling to let such a profitable employee go).\n* For Eothas, there's a blind, blue-skinned aumaua, [Barquami](/barquami/), in the streets of [Lifter's Refuge](/liftersRefuge/). Humorously, he'll wander around for a bit before exiting the area.\n\n'''Return to the Pegleg troupe in the Radiant Court:'''\n* On the way back to the [Radiant Court](/radiantCourt/) you will be accosted in the [street](/shantyStreet/) by four thugs lead by [Eamund the Fox](/eamundTheFox/) who heard about your deal with Harker. After dispatching them, continue on your way to the play.\n* Watching the performance grants you {{cp2|1500}}.\n\n##  Party reactions \n\nAfter the performance, companions will offer their opinion on the play:\n\n* [Edér](/ederTeylecg/): ''\"I'd see it again.\"''\n* [Xoti](/xoti/): ''\"Our temple plays aren't half so entertaining. Let's watch it again.\"''\n\n* [Aloth](/alothCorfiser/): ''\"Was that supposed to be a comedy?\"''\n* [Serafen](/serafen/):''\"Almost felt like I were there!\"''\n* [Pallegina](/palleginaMesRei/): ''Pallegina groans and puts her face in her hands. You've heard this type of groan from her before, but only when she was in intense physical pain.''\n* [Maia](/maiaRua/): ''\"You're telling me they don't get to shoot him or anything? I want my money back.\"''\n* [Tekēhu](/tekehu/): ''\"An excellent first act.
