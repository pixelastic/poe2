[Martino Valera](/martinoValera/) will require a token of your loyalty: Get rid of the RDC sailors at [The Wild Mare](/theWildMare/), who are boasting of their achievements in hunting pirates across the Deadfire. \n* Head to the Wild Mare, dropping by [Zili Valera](/ziliValera/) if you want a peaceful solution. The soldiers are drinking on the upper floor balcony. Talk to [Shrimp](/shrimp/), who will recognize the Watcher from [Defiance Bay](/defianceBay/). Then you can politely ask them to clear out. You can use [Bluff](/bluff/) 4 to make the crew leave, tell them to swing by Zili Valera, or intimidate/attack them. Martino prefers bloodshed, but the RDC would rather you didn't kill their sailors.\n** If [A Sinking Feeling](/aSinkingFeeling/) is active and you speak to Zili about Persa first, dialog will be locked and Zili will not be available to distract the sailors until A Sinking Feeling is complete.\n**If [Maia](/maiaRua/) is in your party, the sailors will recognize her, and you can ask her to scare them off to resolve the situation without bloodshed.\n* Return to Martino. Once you hand the quest in, you have a few days before the heist happens, giving you the ability to finish [Family Pride](/familyPride/).\n*[Shrimp](/shrimp/) carries a [Ring of the Marksman](/ringOfTheMarksman/), which can be looted if you kill the sailors.\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/03_Neketaka_Vailian_District/03_TSK_Valera_Favor.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''A Bigger Fish'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>Martino</b> wants a few Rauataian sailors expelled from the vicinity of the <b>Queen's Berth tavern</b>.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Find the <b>sailors</b>.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| Martino wants a group of Royal Deadfire Company <b>sailors</b> ousted from the <b>Wild Mare</b> in Queen's Berth.
