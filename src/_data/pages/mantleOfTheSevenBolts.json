The wizard's initial experiments were promising - the garment seemed to absorb and redirect the effects of the wizard's most potent lightning spells. After countless self-administered shocks he was left no worse for wear, save for a few burns and a persistent nervous twitch that intensified with his proximity to metal objects.\n\nEver a perfectionist, the enchanter was unsatisfied with his limited data. Simple spells were insufficient. He needed to pit the cape against the fury of a proper storm. When such a storm arrived, the wizard donned the cape and climbed to the spire atop his laboratory and called the lightning to himself. Seven lightning bolts struck the wizard simultaneously, throwing him from the spire to his sand garden below. There was a brilliant flash upon impact that turned the sand to glass and set his arboretum aflame. Broken and concussed, but very much alive, the enchanter praised his experiment as a resounding success.\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Cape\n| item_type      = Cloak\n| item_category  = Accessory\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = yes\n| value          = 1110\n| shop_value     = 5550\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = Grounded;Storm of Seven Bolts (enchantment){{!}}Storm of Seven Bolts;Final Storm\n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = \n| rel_items      = \n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = Back_U_Mantle_of_the_Seven_Bolts\n| location       = * [[Periki's Overlook]]: Sold by [[Iolfr]] of [[Iolfr's Raiments]].\n| guid           = 1ce0c327-c6e7-46cc-8bc8-66b696eed545\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a cloak in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
