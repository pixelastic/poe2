I trust that you understand our bargain will endure only so long as it is of benefit to the Company which I represent.\n\nJust as I trust you understand that the moment this ceases to be the case, I will not trouble either of us in seeking your excuses and apologies. I will forget your name, mestre, and the Company privateers will show you and your crew no more mercy than any other disreputable outlaw.\n\nWith that understanding between us, let us proceed now as friends.\n\nI have enclosed a writ for your safe passage, should you require it, and express renewed hope that you may one day seek to rejoin us in a more civilized setting.\n\nRespectfully, Ignato Castol\"\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Quest item\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = no\n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = Honor Among Thieves\n| rel_items      = Oiled Iron Key\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = item_quest_17_furrante_castol_proof\n| location       = * [Balefire Beacon](/balefireBeacon/): Found in a locked chest in in Furrante's Study (southwestern corner), [Difficulty](/mechanics/) 15 or [Oiled Iron Key](/oiledIronKey/).
