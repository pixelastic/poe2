Elws believed that Eothas and Ondra were not two separate entities, but rather two aspects of a single god. He considered the eclipse, the embrace of the sun and moon, to be the ultimate expression of this fact. Furthermore, he preached against the very existence of any other gods.\n\nAt the height of the eclipse the apostate raised his flail to the heavens and blessed it in the name of the One Unified God. At that moment his eyes burned and he was instantly struck blind. The weapon was indeed imbued with power, but the sacrifice for this blessing was steep. Some of Elws' followers were convinced this was proof of the truthfulness of his claims, while others saw it as nothing more than divine punishment for his blasphemies.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Flail\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 5715\n| shop_value        = 25718\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| attack_time       = 0.5\n| recovery_time     = 3.0\n| penetration       = 11\n| handing           = One-handed\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 6-11\n| damage_type       = Crush\n| weapon_bonuses    = Arcing Blows\n| curr_enchantments = Legendary weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Legendary;Twin Gods;Celestial Attunement\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Flail_U_Sun_And_Moon\n| location          = * [Dunnage](/dunnage/), [Radiant Court](/radiantCourt/): Sold by [Dimesa](/dimesa/) in [The Treasure Trove](/theTreasureTrove/). \n| guid              = d2aaa750-da00-48ab-954b-d206a6ecd1e2\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Flail}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n##  Description \n\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n##  Acquisition \n\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n## Upgrades\n\n###### Notes: Lunar and Solar upgrades are mutually exclusive\n\n{{pe2crafttable|cols=5|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sun_And_Moon_Lunar_Excellence-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|9c87551c-1d2b-4c8d-b646-39269539fa75}}\n|effect = 5% chance to repeat attacks after 0.5 sec with Frost attacks (during nighttime)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =8fecf40c-f616-43bb-9e73-d1c5a2c0aebf\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =5a72bd37-59b3-473d-ab2f-a9c44673efa4\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =e1c769f6-0c15-4263-adfd-5801e482208f\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =a10541f0-c4f2-44dc-8300-f8b13ed615df\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =dd2c7015-e6bb-46ad-b519-83d54ea61210\n|q5   =1\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sun_And_Moon_Solar_Excellence-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|f4cc1ec2-d749-491c-966e-58d220ed07a0}}\n|effect = 5% chance to repeat attacks after 0.5 sec with Fire attacks (during daytime)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =9aacb93a-e4b5-40db-9a3b-4cbdde2f18fd\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =8d94986f-66cd-4b0d-8e30-e2c58aa574fe\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =862d2279-7e31-45bf-b790-ae22a481548f\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =e1c769f6-0c15-4263-adfd-5801e482208f\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =1da67dfc-b306-4286-b5aa-0b1a9bcc5ea8\n|q5   =1\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sun_And_Moon_Golden_Sun_Eothas-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|b5a27604-2590-4b0a-8556-83690034f63a}}\n|effect =25% Burn Damage from weapon returns Health (during daytime)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =88b6a5f3-65c5-49f2-bd8a-49d8bc792645\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =44ad3e99-fd00-4649-aafa-40a8bbefd790\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =f5ab3a19-47bd-4935-9a27-9c495996fcab\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =1da67dfc-b306-4286-b5aa-0b1a9bcc5ea8\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =688d451c-c2a9-49c5-81b5-d64f1d315ea3\n|q5   =1\n|removed=\n}}\n<!--Name:Recipe_Sun_And_Moon_Silver_Moon_Ondra-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|58399fa3-cef8-4ffa-9dc4-50aebabf2c88}}\n|effect =Freeze damage from weapon reduces target Max Health by 50% of damage dealt (during nighttime)\n|cost =3000\n|ing1 =44ad3e99-fd00-4649-aafa-40a8bbefd790\n|q1   =1\n|ing2 =9a31f953-b8a8-4d9b-9de9-457ed3712963\n|q2   =1\n|ing3 =c78ae47d-60ff-4dbc-8aa3-f4778e7c6f0d\n|q3   =1\n|ing4 =dd2c7015-e6bb-46ad-b519-83d54ea61210\n|q4   =1\n|ing5 =a4008698-e3e6-4113-b33d-64bdb6269416\n|q5   =1\n|removed=\n}}\n}}",
