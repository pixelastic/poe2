The young craftswoman, noted for her talent at engraving and jewelry, received the unfinished blade from her local lord with a commission for a brass crossguard and pommel.\n\nElated at the trust shown in her talents, the artisan worked tirelessly to complete the order. As she etched and polished, her faithful dog Griffin stayed at her side day and night. As days turned to weeks, the artisan began to forego food and sleep in her effort to fulfill her commission. When she became discouraged, Griffin - her ever faithful companion - was there to encourage her with a nuzzle and a loving lick.\n\nOne day while working, the artisan looked down at her feet to find her beloved canine companion cold and still. Griffin had died curled at her feet, faithful to the last. Heartbroken, the artisan decided to commemorate the hound on the piece into which she had poured her heart and soul. She crafted the pommel into Griffin's likeness, taking some comfort in knowing that when the lord carried his sword, he too would always have a loyal companion at his side.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Sword\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1207\n| shop_value        = 6035\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             = \n| handing           = One-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| penetration       = 8\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 17-25\n| damage_type       = Slash;Pierce\n| weapon_bonuses    = \n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Howling Blade;Loyal Companion\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Sword_U_Griffins_Blade\n| location          = * While traveling to the Gullet in Neketaka, the Watcher can trigger a random encounter where a group of Skuldr and Cave Grubs are attacking a young girl, [[Kusi]].
