The limited food supply is a major problem, offset by the presence of [Vailian Trading Company](/vailianTradingCompany/) trade routes in close proximity. It currently has 64 inhabitants (99% island aumaua and 1% mountain dwarf), with no major exports or imports. It's governed by the usual Huana tribal caste system and a ranga, with Ondra and Hylea worship most common.<ref>World map statistics.</ref>\n\nDuring the colonization period, Tikawara was the site of the infamous \"bear incident\", when a total of ten colonists were torn apart by local bears.<ref>{{poe2}} encyclopedia: \"''Bears are widely distributed across the Deadfire Archipelago. They favor dens dug into hillsides where their preferred foods - murkberries, yalōa nuts, and ants - are plentiful. Slightly smaller than their Eastern Reach cousins, Deadfire bears are nonetheless vicious opponents when goaded to violence.\n<br/>''In the early years of Deadfire colonization, colonists were occasionally killed in bear attacks. The Tikawara bear incident is particularly infamous. Seven colonists died in the first attack, then three more the following night when the bear returned during a funeral vigil.\n<br/>''On occasion, Deadfire bears have been known to fall prey to tigers, adult females and their cubs being especially vulnerable.
