It was the first step towards establishing a presence in the Deadfire Archipelago, representing a permanent stake in the region. In time, Port Maje became a major waypoint for ships sailing to more prosperous frontiers. Though it is not grand in stature compared to later Vailian settlements, it sits on well-established trade routes from the Eastern Reach and is a common stopping point for ships in the region. It has a close, if often fraught, relationship with the nearby Huana village of Sātahuzi. In particular, border friction is a problem, as the [Huana](/huana/) have a very different concept of land ownership compared to the foreigners. \n\nAs of 2328 AI, Port Maje and [Sātahuzi](/satahuzi/) are home to 3,200 kith. The major religions are [Ondra](/ondra/), [Woedica](/woedica/), and [Eothas](/eothas/). The towns import wheat, silk, leather, cotton textiles, animancy equipment, and marble, while exporting local goods like palm oil, vorlas, arrack, rice, fish, and Engwithan relics.
