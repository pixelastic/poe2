Wish I could say the same about you.\n\nSome day you might learn what it means to be a part of something important. You'll probably get yourself killed long before that revelation takes hold, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. You have a knack for survival that I admire.\n\nYou're more than your busted up castle and twisted soul. You have the chance to be something incredible. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can get to work on making Eora a better place with the rest of us.\n\nBest of luck, ~Maia Rua\n\n''Below the signature the parchment is marked with the indentation of a familiar talon.''\n| added_in       = poe2\n| equipment_slot = Unequippable\n| item_type      = Document\n| item_category  = Other item\n| requirements   = \n| is_soulbound   = no\n| is_unique      = \n| value          = 0\n| range          = \n| level1_spells  = \n| level2_spells  = \n| level3_spells  = \n| level4_spells  = \n| level5_spells  =\n| level6_spells  = \n| level7_spells  = \n| level8_spells  = \n| item_bonuses   = \n| enchantments   = \n| rel_quests     = Sabotage at the Brass Citadel;Taking Out the Traders\n| rel_items      = Maia's Farewell\n| rel_abilities  = \n| rel_talents    = \n| internalname   = MISC_Maia_Missive_Post_Powderhouse\n| location       = * Added to the inventory if Maia deserts you for blowing up the Brass Citadel in [[Sabotage at the Brass Citadel]] or [[Taking Out the Traders]].\n| guid           =81700f52-4614-4c5e-baba-8a1cb1d44f24\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Document }} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}",
