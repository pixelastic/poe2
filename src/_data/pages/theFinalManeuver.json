  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [faction quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsFactionQuests/) in {{poe2}}. It is the final quest in the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/) quest chain.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n \nThe hazanui would like the Watcher's help with something, but she will not give details unless they commit fully to aiding the Royal Deadfire Company.\n\nIf the Watcher cements his alliance with her, there will likely be no turning back.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* Speak with [Hazanui Karū](/hazanuiKaru/) at [Imperial Command](/imperialCommand/). If you commit to the RDC, she will ask that you assassinate [Queen Onekaza II](/queenOnekazaIi/) in order to allow the Rauatai to take over the archipelago.\n** Note: If try to back out after committing, the quest fails and everybody in the Brass Citadel turns hostile.\n* Leave Imperial Command. All city districts except [Serpent's Crown](/serpentsCrown/) are now inaccessible, as the Rauataians will be shelling Vailian ships and VTC infrastructure to provide a diversion.\n* Sneak or murder your way through Serpent's Crown and the palace to reach the queen on the palace rooftop. The discussion inevitably concludes with a battle with the queen, her tigers and guards. Among the loot is the queen's [Serpent Crown](/serpentCrown/).\n** Alternatively, you can kill [Prince Aruihi](/princeAruihi/) instead of the queen to complete the quest.\n* Leave the palace. [Atsura](/atsura/) will have a brief conversation with you.\n* Return to the [Brass Citadel](/brassCitadel/). Karū then introduces you to your new means of travel: the [Blade of Takōwa](/bladeOfTakowa/), a Rauatai submarine. This completes the quest as well as the overarching main quest [The Coming Storm](/theComingStorm/). \n\n## Consequences\n\n* Accepting this quest will side you with the [Royal Deadfire Company](/royalDeadfireCompany/).\n* [Tekēhu](/tekehu/) won't accept your actions in this quest. He will leave your company, at the beginning of the quest if he is part of the party, or else soon after its completion. In the latter case you can still briefly talk to him in the city, though, and strip him of any valuable equipment. He'll leave you [Tekēhu's Farewell](/tekehusFarewell/). \n* [Pallegina](/pallegina/) will leave your company when accepting the quest, or after leaving Imperial Command if not in your current party. She'll leave you [Pallegina's Farewell](/palleginasFarewell/) and returns to the Valian Republics. \n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>Quests/XX_RDC_Faction_Questline/FCT_QST_RDC06_Coup.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''The Final Maneuver'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| I have finalized my alliance with the Royal Deadfire Company, and they are ready to seize control of the Deadfire Archipelago. <b>Hazanui Karū</b> has asked me to assassinate <b>Queen Onekaza</b>.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | '''Alternate descriptions'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 40001\n| <b>Hazanui Karū</b> has a final request for me.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''1'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Speak with <b>Hazanui Karū</b> at <b>Imperial Command</b> in the Brass Citadel.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10001\n| The <b>hazanui</b> would like my help with something, but she will not give me details unless I commit fully to aiding the Royal Deadfire Company.\n\nIf I cement my alliance with her, there will likely be no turning back.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''2'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Infiltrate <b>Kahanga Palace</b> in Serpent's Crown.'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10002\n| Hazanui Karū asked me to assassinate <b>Queen Onekaza II</b>.
