  "markdown": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the final [quest](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireQuestsTheForgottenSanctum/) in {{lax3}}.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nFyonlecg, a powerful wizard, has descended into the titanic living body of the deity Wael. If I'm to prevent Maura's murderer from bending the entity to his will, I will have to locate him before he can do further harm.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nThe quest is the final stage of the DLC and requires the player to first complete both wings of the facility. The goal is to enter the lowest levels of the Temple and find the Oracle. Make sure to grab [The Seeds of Deception](/theSeedsOfDeception/) from either [Tayn](/tayn/) or [Llengrath](/llengrath/) first.\n\n## =The Upper Bowels\n\n=\nEnter [The Upper Bowels](/theUpperBowels/), accessed through [The Scriptorium](/theScriptorium/), after sacrificing a memory to the machine in the center of the room. After watching a grisly scene of a caretaker dissolved by bile, your goal is to disable the three ducts to turn off the bile. \n\n'''The Archives Subbasement (northeast corner)'''\n* On your way to the room, loot the [Fungal Ingredient](/fungalIngredient/) from the fungus on the wall.\n* If you resolved the conversation with the [Giant Luminescent Spore](/giantLuminescentSpore/) peacefully, the spores will open the path for you. Otherwise, they won't help you and you will need to fight them.\n* Without their help you need to solve the puzzle, which requires placing the correct books on edited Eoran history on the lecterns (you can loot them from the nearby shelves):\n** [The History of Eora, Volume XI: The Rediscovery of Yezuha](/theHistoryOfEoraVolumeXiTheRediscoveryOfYezuha/)\n**: ''The gods lost them, but we will find them again.''\n** [The History of Eora, Volume XIV: The Vanishing of Godlikes](/theHistoryOfEoraVolumeXivTheVanishingOfGodlikes/) \n**: ''They think their difference is a blessing when it is but a brand.''\n** [The History of Eora, Volume XIII: The Last Ice Age](/theHistoryOfEoraVolumeXiiiTheLastIceAge/)\n**: ''Death comes for all in time.''\n** [The History of Eora, Volume XV: The Throne of Woedica](/theHistoryOfEoraVolumeXvTheThroneOfWoedica/) \n**: ''In their fear, they will give her power and ask for safety. But she will give them only orders.''\n* Note: Be sure to loot the piece of the godseed on the pedestal for [The Seeds of Deception](/theSeedsOfDeception/).\n* The newly unlocked room will contain The Bowels Alchemist assisted by a number of Dreambeasts. Loot the [Antiseptic Cream](/antisepticCream/) from the workbench after killing them.\n* Interact with the duct across from the workbench. You will have the option to combine the Fungal Ingredient and the Antiseptic Cream to the fluid, causing the bile to congeal and stop the duct.\n\n'''The Observation Center (northwest corner)'''\n* Eliminate the Observers and their assistants, then destroy the polyps, which will pop the nearby eye and stop another duct.\n* Note: In this area there's also [Blinky](/blinky/) to collect. Also, between The Observation Center and The Archives Subbasement, make sure to grab a [Fragment of Starmetal](/fragmentOfStarmetal/).\n\n'''Memory Siphon (southwest corner)'''\n* Kill the scavengers and The Deep Wrangler, but be careful not to step in the glowing wards on the floor, as they will inflict [injuries](/statusEffectsInjury/) and possibly kill your party. (The wards will not be present if you read Tayn's spell into the organ)\n* Note: Be sure to loot the piece of the godseed on the pedestal for [The Seeds of Deception](/theSeedsOfDeception/).\n* Head to the room just to the east, the Excavation Site.\n* Loot the [Alchemical Charge](/alchemicalCharge/) from the table near the caretakers.\n** They will turn hostile if they catch you taking the charge, or they will attack after setting it.\n* Interact with the duct and plant the device. It will explode and take out the last duct.\n\nReturn to the center of the area and prepare for the final boss fight. When you're ready, descend into [The Heart of Mystery](/theHeartOfMystery/) to the final confrontation.\n\n## =Heart of Mystery\n\n=\n\nYou'll find [Fyonlecg](/fyonlecg/) standing before the [Oracle of Wael](/oracleOfWael/), beckoning for the creature to absorb his [essence](/soulEssence/). After he is absorbed, you can have a brief conversation with him before the fight begins. Absorbing Fyonlecq turns the Oracle into a heavy spellcaster, aided by a throng of supporting monsters including the Scavenger of Visions.\n\nTips for the battle:\n* The Oracle is immune to [Mind Afflictions](/statusEffectsDeadfireNegativeEffects/) and [Flanking](/statusEffectsFlanked/).\n* Spell reflections are useful to keep the damage manageable.\n* [Withdraw](/withdraw/) can be useful for party members focused by his laser beams.\n* [Wall of Many Colors](/wallOfManyColors/), [Concelhaut's Crushing Doom](/concelhautsCrushingDoom/), [Meteor Shower](/meteorShower/) and other interrupting abilities are useful against the oracle. Especially when any Scavengers of Visions appear, giving you time to lock them down/kill them. \n* However, note that the adds can be hurt by his beam. You can damage them if you position them between you and the oracle. \n* Destroying any Arcane Channels will apply [Losing Control](/losingControl/) to the Oracle, which will briefly stun it.\n* Destroying the Artery Polyps creates a [slog zone](/statusEffectsDeadfireOtherAfflictions/) that will affect your party and any adds.\n* When the Oracle is down to Near Death, petrifying it will basically knock it out of the fight until it can be finally killed. [Touch of Death](/touchOfDeath/) or [Worthy Sacrifice](/worthySacrifice/) from [Marux Amanth](/maruxAmanth/) can be used to finish him.\n\nLooting the body of Fyonlecg will give [The Mask of the Weyc](/theMaskOfTheWeyc/) (if not looted before). Choosing to finish the oracle after the scripted interaction will drop the [Ring of Clenched Muscle](/ringOfClenchedMuscle/). Be sure to loot the piece of the godseed on the pedestal for [The Seeds of Deception](/theSeedsOfDeception/).\n\n## =Endings\n\n=\nDefeating the Oracle will cause [Wael](/wael/) to appear and give the player the chance to decide what to do with the body below the Black Isles. The decision affects the [end-game slides](/pillarsOfEternityIiDeadfireEndingsTheForgottenSanctum/), and can have additional consequences.\n\n<!-- LAX3_n_Body_Choice 1 -->\n# Put the body back to sleep.\n## Requires Arcana 13 or Diplomacy 16 or being a priest of Wael.\n## Wael will tell you to spare the Oracle.\n<!-- LAX3_n_Body_Choice 0 -->\n# Let the body die.\n## Can be passed without any special checks, tell Wael \"When the titans were last active, they almost destroyed Eora.\"\n## Wael will tell you to finish the Oracle.\n<!-- LAX3_n_Body_Choice 3 -->\n# Turn the body against Eothas.\n## Requires Arcana 13 or being a priest of Wael.\n## Or say, \"You should really use the body to help us with the Eothas problem\" then pass a Religion 10 or Metaphysics 8 or Clever 2 check.\n## Wael will tell you to finish the Oracle.\n## This will result in the titan attacking Eothas at [Ukaizo](/ukaizo/).
