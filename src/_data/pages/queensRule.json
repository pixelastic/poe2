Emissaries from the Aedyr Empire presented it, along with seven similar weapons, to the first duc of the Free Palatinate of Dyrwood upon the conclusion of the War of Defiance. Intended as a gesture of peace, such a gift also signified de facto recognition of the Free Palatinate. The duc, pleased by acknowledgement of his rule, accepted.\n\nAs a gesture of solidarity with those who fought for Dyrwoodan independence, the duc distributed six of the weapons to his erls. The two Cavalier blades went to Helsgate and Coldwater. The Grasp and Norwaech received the Tower hammers. To Ashfall and Tenferths went the Abbot staves\n\nThe two remaining great swords, Queen's Rule and King's Wrath, the duc ordered smelted down. In his words, the Free Palatinate no longer had any use for royalty. It seems this weapon was saved from the fire, though it has had a long fall from grace.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Great sword\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 1660\n| shop_value        = 8300\n| combat_type       = Melee\n| range             =\n| handing           = Two-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 4.0\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 23-31\n| damage_type       = Slash;Pierce\n| penetration       = 9\n| weapon_bonuses    = \n| curr_enchantments = Exceptional weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Exceptional;Capture (enchantment){{!}}Capture\n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Great_Sword_U_Queens_Rule\n| location          = * [[Periki's Overlook]]: Sold by [[Marihi]] of [[Marihi's Metalwork]].\n| guid              = 6fa1e8b1-59da-490d-9b58-0889c7d0371a\n}}\n'''{{Pagename nd}}''' is a {{lc:Great sword}} in {{poe2}}.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description |{{#var:description}}}}\n\n== Acquisition ==\n{{#arraymap: {{#var:location}}|;|x|x|\\n}}\n\n== Upgrades ==\n;Notes: Checkmate and Promote are mutually exclusive.\n{{Pe2crafttable|cols=3|\n<!--Name:Recipe_Queens_Rule_Checkmate-->\n{{Pe2craftmod|\n|mod  ={{pe2mod|988d9240-747f-496a-8265-88c83b4eb29b}}\n|effect = Grants [[Checkmate]]: Swaps position with an enemy in a 4m range.
