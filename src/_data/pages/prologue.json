Among the devastation, the [Watcher](/watcher/) remains on the brink of death as his soul is pulled by [Berath](/berath/) into a special audience - the gods need the Watcher's help.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This is the prologue and you cannot fail it (it is not technically a quest). Follow the luminous path to the end, until you come across the pillar of [adra](/adra/). Beyond you will meet the Usher, who will ''usher'' you into a chamber where the Pallid Knight sits. She will explain your situation, that Eothas awoke, snatched a part of your soul, and that you're needed by the gods to tie off the bloody stump that is the Dead God. She will then offer you the ability to confirm your past. \n* Apart from six pre-made legacies, you can import your endgame save at this point. To do so, it must be located in ''Pillars'' save game directory (this is automatic if you have Steam and {{poe1}} installed). The game will helpfully mark the choices you make.\n* You may choose to  defy Berath and say that you won't work with the gods under any circumstances, in which case you will be returned to the in-between and you will progress to an ending. \n*If you agree with Berath you wiill progress to character creation, where you can remake your character from scratch (the game doesn't import your character automatically). After you (re)create your character, follow the path to the captain's quarters on ''[The Defiant](/theDefiant/)'' - and [Edér](/eder/).\n* Of course, your ship comes immediately under attack by pirates as soon as you wake up. [Eld Engrim](/eldEngrim/) runs in, reeking of alcohol to inform you of that sad fact of life in the Deadfire. The man in question is [Benweth](/benweth/), a jumped-up sailor with delusions of grandeur. No matter what you say, you need to fight the enemy boarders. After either they're dead or you're knocked out, the scripted interaction starts. You first need to decide whether to save [Chitupec](/chitupec/) or a crate of salvage from [Caed Nua](/caedNua/) (the crate contains [Killer's Gloves](/killersGloves/), [Oil of Allure](/oilOfAllure/), and a [Thief's Putty](/thiefsPutty/)).\n* You get a glance of [Eothas](/eothas/) walking in the distance as the Defiant beaches itself on an island.\n\n## Gallery\n\n<tabber>\nGallery=\n<gallery>\n PE2 Prologue Crate.png | The crate\n</gallery>\n|-|\nScripted interaction=\n'''Scripted interaction graphics:'''\n<gallery mode=nolines>\n 00 si prologueStormv2 stormy topside.png | Opening\n 00 si prologueStormv2 crate slide.png | Crate slide\n 00 si prologueStormv2 save chitupec.png | Saving Chitupec\n 00 si prologueStormv2 save crate.png | Saving crate\n 00 si prologue stormy seas.png | Eothas\n 00 si prologueStormv2 watcher overboard.png | Going overboard\n</gallery>\n|-|\nUnused graphics=\n'''Unused scripted interaction graphics:'''\n<gallery mode=nolines>\n 00 si prologue Crate dive 2.png\n 00 si prologue Crate dive.png\n 00 si prologue Crate sliding.png\n 00 si prologue Crate smash.png\n</gallery>\n</tabber>",
