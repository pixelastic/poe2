However, to reach [Neketaka](/neketaka/) intact, you need something more than just timber and nails. You need a crew.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n* This is a simple tutorial quest that introduces the concept of hiring crew and managing them. It is started upon completion of [Stranded](/stranded/), after your ship sets sail from [Vilario's Rest](/vilariosRest/).\n* To complete it, sail to [Port Maje](/portMaje/) and hire enough crew members via the supply interface (or via [Thorel](/thorel/) in [The Kraken's Eye](/theKrakensEye/)) to have at least five sailors. Most of the crew members at Port Maje can be hired for free.\n* Completing the quest [Helping Hands](/helpingHands/) will get you 4 of the 5 crew members required (assuming you saved [Chitupec](/chitupec/)).\n\n## Journal\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"word-break:break-all\" | <small>quests/09_port_maje/09_tsk_skeleton_crew.quest</small>\n|-\n! width=\"40px\" | {{tooltip|ID|Objectives: 0, Descriptions: 10000, Addenda: 20000, End states: 30000, Alternate descriptions: 40000}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | Objectives\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:text-top; text-align:center\" | '''0'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Skeleton Crew'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:text-top\" | 10000\n| <b>The Defiant</b> is ready to head back out to sea, but much of its <b>crew</b> is either missing or dead after the storm.
