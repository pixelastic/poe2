These elite guards were renowned for their deadly accuracy and carried powerful steel crossbows such as this. The Boghadir battle doctrine was twofold. First, any invading force would first come under fire by designated marksmen at range. These marksmen, firing at will, were to diminish and demoralize the attackers. Second - when their enemies closed distance to the walls of the keep, Boghadir point-defenders would then hit them with relentless, coordinated mass-fire, one line after another. If the attackers were repulsed and fell back, they would once again fall under fire from the sharpshooters. At no point was the enemy to have any respite from a steady rain of crossbow bolts.\n| added_in          = poe2\n| equipment_slot    = Weapon\n| weapon_type       = Crossbow\n| requirements      = \n| is_soulbound      = no\n| is_unique         = yes\n| value             = 3914\n| shop_value        = 19570\n| combat_type       = Ranged\n| range             = 12m \n| handing           = Two-handed\n| attack_time       = 0.7\n| recovery_time     = 5.0\n| penetration       = 12\n| projectiles       = \n| accuracy_mod      = \n| damage            = 22-29 \n| damage_type       = Pierce \n| weapon_bonuses    = Bonus Crit Chance;Unfit For Melee\n| curr_enchantments = Superb weapon (Deadfire){{!}}Superb;Precision (Deadfire){{!}}Precision;Steady \n| weapon_focus      =\n| poss_enchantments = \n| rel_quests        = \n| rel_items         = \n| rel_abilities     = \n| rel_talents       = \n| internalname      = Crossbow_U_Fleetbreaker\n| location          = * Quest reward for [A Shrewd Proposition](/aShrewdProposition/), after you aid the Crookspur slavers.\n* Given by [Captain Furrante](/captainFurrante/) for killing [Captain Aeldys](/captainAeldys/) during [Honor Among Thieves](/honorAmongThieves/) and reading her soul.
