As such, it is a place of particular treachery and the occasional wonder. Two centuries ago, paladin [[Lucia Rivan]] lay claim to the region, electing to establish her keep here. Its location has since passed from collective memory.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* [[File:Icon Splintered Reef.png|50px|left]] '''[[Splintered Reef]]''': Rivan's keep, located far to the southeast.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Reef.png|50px|left]] '''Mara-Mara Trench''': This trench is located to the northwest, at the edge of the Waste. You encounter a whale there and you can either elect to hunt it or let it pass in peace. Crew members from the Deadfire will be non-plussed about killing a messenger of Ngati.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=200px>\n PE2 Mara-Mara Trench.png | Mara-Mara Trench\n</gallery>",
