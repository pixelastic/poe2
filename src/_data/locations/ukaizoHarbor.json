Some legends regard Ukaizo as the wellspring of Huana culture. Others tell of riches beyond measure. All agree that Ukaizo vanished after cataclysmic storms and volcanic eruptions blotted out the horizon, but it remains to be seen if these tales possess an echo of merit or simply romanticize an ancient fantasy. Once you land at the harbor, however, it becomes clear that it is no myth.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This large arena is where you confront and destroy the [[Guardian of Ukaizo]].\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Guardian of Ukaizo]]",
