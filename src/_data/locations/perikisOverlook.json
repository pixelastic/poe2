Rather than pester you for a bit of coin or a bite of food, the children here try to sell you tickets to a play or extol the benefits of the public baths. Periki's Overlook is the artisan district of the city and an exemplar of this trend. [[Periki]] was an explorer and founder of the [[Watershapers Guild (faction)|Watershapers Guild]]. Many of the modern teachings of watershaping stem from her research into ancient [[Huana]] society, which led to her posthumous renown and the subsequent naming of her home district in [[Neketaka]] as Periki's Overlook.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a large mercantile district dominated by the mansion of Archmage Arkemyr and the Watershapers Guild. Both of these lie at the edge of the terrace, overlooking the lower parts of Neketaka. The mercantile part of the district is focused around the inner plaza, with [[Marihi's Metalwork]]  and [[Luminous Bathhouse]] in the center. Clockwise from the entrance are [[Cuitztli's Exotic Herbs]], [[The Dark Cupboard]], and [[Iolfr's Raiments]].\n* While on the balcony of the [[Luminous Bathhouse]], if any character in the party has the ability [[Leap]], a new interactable will appear on the railing. When clicked, the party will collectively jump over the railing and onto the ground below, saving you a few moments of loading and walking time. Manually casting Leap is not possible in this instance since the ground is not within line of sight.\n** Likewise, another interactable will appear on the battlements between the bedroom and upper floor balconies of [[Arkemyr's Manor]].\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Degnos]], located outside of the [[Luminous Bathhouse]] and initiates the [[Sealed Fate]] task.\n* [[Emaita]], beverage vendor.\n* [[Wekeme]], food vendor. Only in the morning.\n* [[Worthless Idiot]], this imp can be recruited as a navigator on your ship.\n* [[Tumara]] and [[Netehe]], arguing outside of Arkemyr's manor.\n\n==Pets==\n* [[Jules]] - \"Stray Cat\", in the gardens next to the [[Watershapers Guild]].\n* [[Rasper]] - \"Abandoned Dog\", to the right of [[Iolfr's Raiments]].\n* [[Noah]] - \"Forsaken Cat\", on the balcony of the [[Luminous Bathhouse]].\n\n==Plants==\n* 4x [[Glaive Berries]]\n* 6x [[Gaensvef Berries]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" style=\"text-align:center\">\nPE2_The_Dark_Cupboard_Exterior.png | [[The Dark Cupboard]] / [[Cuitztli's Exotic Herbs]] (offscreen)\nPE2_Marihi's_Metalwork_Exterior.png | [[Marihi's Metalwork]]\nPE2_Iolfr's_Raiments_Exterior.png | [[Iolfr's Raiments]]\nPE2_Luminous_Bathhouse_Exterior.png | [[Luminous Bathhouse]]\nPE2_Arkemyr's_Manor_Exterior.png | [[Arkemyr's Manor]]\nPE2_Watershapers_Guild_Exterior.png | [[Watershapers Guild]]\nPE2_Periki.png | [[Periki]], the district's namesake\n</gallery>",
