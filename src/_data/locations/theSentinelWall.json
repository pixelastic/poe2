Now it is damaged and littered with the ashen remain of their warriors.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The Wall has been severely damaged by Eothas' passing. The passage to the north leads to a room overlooking the naked adra statue and has a few goodies. To progress, head to the workshop behind the locked door and deal with the Rathun in the way. You can try to talk them down - say you do not follow Eothas, then use Metaphysics 5 to note your soul wasn't eaten, Religion 5 to ..., or Insight 5 to point out their anger is misdirected.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sentinel Wall, The}}",
