They are largely unsettled, making them a haven for a variety of shady characters.\n\nTo the north lies [[Magran's Teeth]], and the storms of [[Ondra's Mortar]] beyond. To the east is [[Mortar's Wrath]], a mostly empty section of deep sea.\n\n==Islands==\n;Western islands\n[[File:PE2 KoR West.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* A mass of islands with three to explore and [[Onadere the Temptress]] to track down.\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Northwestern\n[[File:PE2 Bekarnas Observatory Island.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* [[Bekarna's Observatory]]: The remote residency of the archmage [[Bekarna]].\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Central\n[[File:PE2 KoR Central.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* Another mass of islands with a few places to explore.\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;North-central\n[[File:PE2 Cleft You Say.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* A small island to the north. Contains three locations: An isolated beach, an abandoned village, and the Whenura Cleft. At the isolated beach you can encounter [[naga]] and a totem, then loot the village they sacked.\n\n* Whenura Cleft is a little more interesting. Once you cross the odd rope, you will find a tree full of dead people hanging off of it, all suspiciously similar to the set up back in [[Gilded Vale|Gilded Vale.]] Once you order your crew to cut them down, you will receive the [[Footprints of Ahu Taka]] and can learn that the island was wiped out by a group of raiders from the Dyrwood, who murdered the druid, broke the elders, burned down the holy tree, and hanged the entire Huana village.\n\n* To the northeast you can also find the [[collapsed coal mine]].\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Eastern\n[[File:PE2 KoR Ikorno.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* A lonely island where [[Ikorno]] makes camp.\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Southeastern\n[[File:PE2 KoR Flamewalker.png|left|300px|thumb]]\n* This old lagoon is where you can find an abandoned village and [[Flamewalker Vessali]] for the bounty.\n<br clear=\"left\" />\n;Northeastern - \"Motare Cluster\"\n[[file:PE2 Motare o Kozi.png|left|thumb|300px]]\n* The vast lagoon that marks the north-eastern end of the island chain houses [[Motare o Kōzi]]. However, to access it, you first need to navigate the Hungry Shoals and Matekau Landing. The shoals refers to a vast reef of underground adra that you must navigate. In order to pass through without problems, you need to have a Master Helmsman (level 4). Matekau landing is where you will encounter [[Wahaki]] warriors led by [[Embēta]]. You can navigate with Diplomacy 4 or Intimidate 5, then you must either have Intimidate 7, a Druid class, a Good 3 reputation with the Huana, ''or'' have completed [[A Shrewd Proposition]] by siding with the Wahaki. \n* Make sure to raid the burial site to find [[Blightheart]].\n<br clear=\"left\"/>\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the [[Backer Beta]], Kua o Rikuhu is situated in the south eastern section of the \"full\" world map, and includes the islands dotted around [[Tikawara]]. In the full game, the Kua o Rikuhu Islands are located to the north east, and are comprised of a completely different set of islands, while the islands in the south east are now known as the [[Tehiwai Islands]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n PE2 Kua o Rikuhu Islands Beta.png | [[Backer Beta]] version of the islands\n</gallery>",
