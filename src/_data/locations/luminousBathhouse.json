The bathwaters are infused with hand-refined luminous adra, which promotes a holistic balance of the humors (according to the steward). Because of luminous adra's remarkable qualities, it is also a significant investment to both supply and maintain.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The baths are rather open and full of visitors. Ganor is near the main entrance, offering rooms for rent.\n* Keep in mind the submerged area is a [[Slog Zone]], meaning you cannot run while standing within it.\n;Boiler room\n* Accessible through a stairwell in the lower left of the main floor is the boiler room, containing two attendants taking care of the massive machine. The small passage in the back leads to [[Arkemyr's Manor]] laboratories.\n;Upper floor\n* Contains the three rooms available for rent at this fine establishment. You can rifle through the cupboards with impunity.\n\n==Rooms==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Room\n! Cost\n! Effect(s)\n\n|-\n| style=\"border-right:none\" | [[File:room_bathhouse_01.png|64px]]\n| style=\"border-left:none\" | '''Moistened Cove'''\n| {{cp2|200}}\n|\n*+1 [[Constitution]]\n*+25% Incoming Healing\n\n|-\n| style=\"border-right:none\" | [[File:room_bathhouse_02.png|64px]]\n| style=\"border-left:none\" | '''The Bathyal Drop'''\n| {{cp2|400}}\n|\n*+2 Health per 6.0 sec\n*+1 Max Power Pool\n\n|-\n| style=\"border-right:none\" | [[File:room_bathhouse_03.png|64px]]\n| style=\"border-left:none\" | '''The Abyss'''\n| {{cp2|800}}\n|\n*+25% Beneficial Effect duration\n*+10% Area of Effect\n|}\n\nIn addition to these available rooms, you can speak to the steward to take a dip in the bathhouse pools for {{cp2|1000}} (or {{cp2|900}} if you make him laugh with [[Insight]] 4 and [[Streetwise]] / [[Diplomacy]] 4, {{cp2|2000}} if you piss Ganor off). This counts as resting, and grants [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Misc bonuses|Adratic Glow]] to yourself and all party members (+1 max class resource, and +1 max [[Empower]] points).\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Ganor]], the proprietor\n* [[Bathhouse steward]], who provides the baths themselves\n* [[Amreo]], an elderly patron\n* [[Udyne]], another patron\n* [[Hurwyna]] and [[Seinu]], yet another pair of patrons.\n\n'''During [[Dirty Laundry]]'''\n* [[Brizze]], a VTC spy posing as a bathhouse attendant\n* [[Quarno]], an [[Royal Deadfire Company|RDC]] agent and his [[Accountant]].\n* [[Töla]], a [[Príncipi]] agent.\n\n==Companion reactivity==\nYour companions have reactivity with the steward...\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
