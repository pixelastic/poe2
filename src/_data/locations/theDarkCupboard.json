An imp? Either way, this is the place to visit for high quality wares, as Archmage Arkemyr spared no expense in supplying it.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a single chamber filled with shelves containing loot and items. [[The Spine of Thicket Green]] can be stolen from one of the racks.\n* [[Ifren]], a fortune teller in the corner, will do just that.\n* The stairs in the center lead to the living quarters, where you can access [[Arkemyr's Manor]] via the window (as part of [[The Archmage's Vault]].)\n* As of Patch 4.0, the [[Critter Cleaver]], a peculiar machine of Engwithan origin, appears towards the back of the shop.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Fassina]], the proprietor.\n* [[Bertenno]], at the start of [[Velvet Glove, Brass Fist]].\n* [[Ifren]], a fortune teller.\n\n==Loot==\n* [[The Spine of Thicket Green]], [[Sasha's Singing Scimitar]], [[Lethandria's Devotion]], [[Llengrath's Martial Masteries]], [[Grimoire of Vaporous Wizardry]], [[Ring of Focused Flame]], [[Spellkeeper]], [[Gwyn's Bridal Garter]]: Sold by Fassina.\n* [[Trollhide Belt (Deadfire)|Trollhide Belt]]: In Fassina's chest upstairs.\n* [[Fassina's Journal]]: In the cupboard upstairs.\n* {{s3}} [[Fortuneteller's Ear]]: Obtained from [[Ifren]] for [[The Seeking Face's Hunt for the Fortuneteller's Ear]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* After joining your party, Fassina's job as the shopkeeper is given to a Shop Imp. It sells the same items.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=200px>\nPE2_The_Dark_Cupboard_Exterior.png | Building exterior\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dark Cupboard, The}}",
