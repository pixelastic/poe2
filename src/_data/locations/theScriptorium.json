It serves as the hub for documenting the history of the Halls Obscured themselves, whereas the other wings contain materials redacted from the world above.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The scriptorium consists of a series of platforms with bookcases, connected to a single junction in the center, which holds the [[Chief Librarian]]. The exit to the [[Temple of Revelation]] is to the northeast.\n\n==Loot==\n* [[The Weyc's Oracular Focus]]: Found in a chest that appears after placing the [[Memoirs of Heldr]] on the Lectern of Obfuscation to the east and incinerating [[Heldr's Horn]] at the incinerator to the west.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scriptorium, The}}",
