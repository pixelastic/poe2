It is only accessible during the [[Prologue]].\n\n==Background==\nThe In-Between is a place where spirits dwell before taking their last voyage to the Beyond. It is an other-worldly amalgam of locations suspended in time and space. \n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is the starting area of the game, where you first get the run-down of the events happening in the Deadfire, and create/import your character. It's a simple linear path, and the camera is locked - so there's not much to explore.\n* On the left side is an adra pillar and your starting location. [[The Usher]], a form of [[Berath]] greets you here and leads you to the next area. As you walk forward, a path will form leading to a stone structure held by a giant skeletal hand.\n* After speaking with [[The Pallid Knight]], another form of Berath, you advance to the [[Captain's Cabin]], where you're reunited with your body, and a very-surprised [[Ed√©r]].\n\n==Characters==\n* [[The Usher]], a decrepit form of Berath, who leads you to the central area.\n* [[The Pallid Knight]], a familiar form of Berath, who you interact with throughout the game.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=250px heights=140px>\n PE2 The In-Between.png | Lower half\n PE2 The In-Between 1.png | Upper half\n PE2 The In-Between 2.png | [[Captain's Cabin]]\n</gallery>",
