And of course, the courtesans.\n\n==Points of interest==\n;Lower floor\n* Dominated by the main chamber with the scene in the back, the Mare is an open living space with an enclosed kitchen to the right and dining rooms to the northwest and southwest. [[Gyntel]] mans the counter by the entrance, serving drinks to his rugged clientele.\n;Upper floor\n* The upper floor is simple, with one main entertainment hall and three adjacent rooms for... Business.\n\n==Rooms==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Room\n! Cost\n!
