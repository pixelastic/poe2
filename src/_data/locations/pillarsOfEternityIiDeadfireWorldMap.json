  "raw": "[[File:PE2_World_Map_Travel.png|right|300px|thumb|The world map interface; the party is currently traveling overland on [[Poko Kohara]].]]\n'''''Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire''''' '''world map''' covers the [[Deadfire Archipelago]] and the islands that cover it. It's distinct from [[Pillars of Eternity world map|the previous game]] in that you use a ship, ''[[The Defiant]]'', to travel across the map, explore, and run into various random encounters. \n\n:''To avoid bandwidth overconsumption, the interactive map is found [[Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire interactive world map|here]].''\n==Travel==\nThe key difference between the first game and the second is the fact that travel is much more involved and requires resources. As your ship crosses the archipelago, you need to watch your reserves of cash, food, and water to avoid mutiny, starvation, dehydration, and as a consequence, losing your crew, health, and/or life. Finding the optimal route across the waters of the Archipelago while exploring is a core part of gameplay. \n\nThankfully, once you make landfall - at a port or a bay - your crew is smart enough to forage for food on their own. As long as you stay on land, you only have to pay your crew's wages, without worrying about food. \n\n==Locations==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Zone\n! Region\n! Name\n!

Robbing the ship will net you a collection of cargo, a random item (each different ship will give you a different item) as well as +5 Morale. Helping the crew requires a non-Wilder surgeon (no rank required), -5 Medicine, and will give you -5 Morale and the random item, assuming you accept it). In any case you will get 180 experience and 2 Sailor Experience.\n\nIn boarding their ship, or helping them, you may also contract the plague.\n|-\n! [[File:Icon Farm.png]]<br/>Farm\n!
