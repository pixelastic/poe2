Contains a staging area (as pictured), which is only used in encounters.\n* Navigated through a scripted interactions, the Narrows allow you to reach the following locations:\n** Right, right, left: Entrance to [[Dereo's lair]]. You need an invitation to enter peacefully (see the location page for details). If you attack, you will lose reputation with Delvers Row Criminals but Dereo will be amused and you will still be given a chance to deal with him peacefully.\n** Right, forward, inspect the merchant stall with a Watcher-only [[Perception]] 18 or [[Streetwise]] 6 (these checks are waived if you have been told the directions during [[Delver's Row (quest)]]) and go through the curtain to reach [[Delver's Row]].\n*** You'll be accosted by several thugs and you can pay them off with {{cp2|50}}, use [[Diplomacy]] 4, [[Bluff]] 3, attack, or pass through safely if you talked to Dereo and retrieved the Cornett of Waves for him (this option will not be available unless he has granted you access to the Undercroft). If you choose to attack, you will be put in a staging area used specifically for the fight, and will lose minor reputation with Delver's Row Criminals.\n** Right, forward, forward, forward: A dead body. Perception 14 allows you to find money and a [[Dead Man's Note|note]] (this is Ulog, Mad Morena's messenger).\n** Right, forward, forward, right, forward: A neighbourhood. Offers a number of random encounters.\n** Choosing the option to retrace your steps to the exit will put you in the last location you were at.\n\n==Gallery==\n<tabber>\nMap=\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:10px;\"\n| style=\"padding:20px;\" | <div class=\"res-img\">[[File:PE2 The Narrows map.png]]</div>\n|-\n| <small>Overview map of The Narrows.
