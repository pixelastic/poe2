Thought by many sailors as among the most treacherous places in the archipelago, it surrounds the storms of [[Ondra's Mortar]] and the lost city of [[Ukaizo]] within.\n\nFor protection from any who would want to steal fire from the gods or learn their secrets, the [[Rathun]] prowl the waters surrounding the Teeth. Much like the [[Eyeless]] served Abydon, the Rathun are giants of fire and earth made in the image of [[Magran]].\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Icon Ashen Maw.png|75px|left]]\n:::'''[[Ashen Maw]]''', a major Rathun outpost.<br clear=\"left\" />\n[[File:Icon Camp.png|75px|left]]\n:::[[Urnox Berinth]]: The camp of the infamous Rathun warlord is located at 1° 14'S and\t51° 59' E, in the middle of the Teeth.<br clear=\"left\" />\n\n==Trivia==\n* Magran's Teeth had originally spanned the entire length of Ondra's Mortar, with volcanic islands replacing the regular island chains to the east and north. These islands can still be shown with console commands.",
