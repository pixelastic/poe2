As you near the mine, a loud explosion rocks the ground. A flurry of terrified birds burst from nearby trees, and a massive cloud of dust rockets out of the cave mouth.}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n* A straightforward location at 7° 46’ S, 57° 16’ E, where [[Eccea]] and her team are trying to loot the mine, but badly misjudged its stability and the effects of black powder on it. Once you come a short distance inside, you'll be greeted by a cutscene, which will reveal disagreements within, then Eccea will leave to keep watch.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Eccea]], [[Nathrak]], [[Chei]], [[Tairo]], [[Ulgrim]], [[Munric]]\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Eccea's Arcane Blaster]] and [[Eccea’s Grimoire]]: Carried by the eponymous wizard.\n* [[Adra Ban]] x1.\n* Superb Spear, Superb Large Shield, Superb Brigandine, and several exceptional pieces.",
