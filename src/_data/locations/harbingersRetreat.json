The deceptively small tavern up top houses the entrance to the main temple of the [[Harbingers of Dusk]], and the quarters of [[Vatnir]], the cult's leader.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The Retreat is fairly large, divided into three major areas. The entrance is where you find Valbrendhur who runs the Tip of the Iceberg, the local tavern and waystation for the few travelers who pass through.\n* Through the common room lies the temple, carved out of the glacial ice. [[Vatnir]] is here, presiding over the services.\n* To the northeast are Vatnir's quarters. The skull has a hidden switch (Perception 12 required), which opens the adjacent secret room, containing some minor loot. Interestingly, it seems nobody has been there in a while.\n\n==Characters==\n* High Harbinger  [[Vatnir]], companion and leader.\n* [[Harbinger Valbrendhür]], tavern keeper\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Permafrost shard]]: In the rafters in the entrance room (hidden).",
