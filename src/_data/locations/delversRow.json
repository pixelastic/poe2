Known as Delver's Row, it's a place where most things can be found for the right price and word always travels quickly.}}\nEvery city has its black market and the Delver's Row is the current one, bustling with shops and suspicious characters.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a fairly large area, though with relatively few characters. Just by the entrance is [[Enarat]], a blind orlan cook.\n* [[Rust]] skulks in the corridor to the northeast, with a street merchant selling drugs near the northeastern corner.\n* [[Ernezzo]], a black market smuggler, is in a chamber in the central area, with [[Imuani]] in a chamber opposite. Over the bridge in the north, there's the secret entrance to [[Ernezzo]]'s Supply Room opened using a hidden switch ([[Perception|Difficulty]] 16).\n* [[The Spindle Man]], a [[Vithrack (Deadfire)|Vithrack]] merchant, is in the west.\n* The exit to the [[Undercroft]] is in the northwest. The way is guarded by thugs and the only way to pass peacefully is getting [[Dereo the Lean|Dereo]]'s permission by progressing [[The Cornett's Call]].\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Rust]], an assassin\n;Merchants\n* [[Street Merchant]]\n* [[Ernezzo]]\n* [[Imuani]]\n* [[The Spindle Man]]\n* [[Enarat]]\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Garari Cuirass]]: Sold by [[Ernezzo]].\n* [[The Red Hand]]: Sold by [[Ernezzo]]. Can be stolen from his supply room in a locked chest (difficulty 12).\n* [[Rekvu's Fractured Casque]] and [[The Undying Burden]]: Sold by [[Imuani]].\n* [[Sisyfo's Stone]], [[Spindle Man's Grimoire]], [[Ring of Regeneration]],  [[Whitewitch Mask]], and [[Obsidian Lamp Figurine (Deadfire)|Obsidian Lamp Figurine]]: Sold by [[the Spindle Man]].\n* [[Algol]]: Canine pet.
