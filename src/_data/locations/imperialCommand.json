It is built in the characteristic style of modern Rauataian architecture, but the beauty does not inhibit function.\n\n==Points of interest==\n;Upper level\n* The upper floor is where the office of the hazanui is located, opposite the entrance. The quartermastery and [[Sabormi]] is located in the right wing, next to the stairs leading downward.\n;Lower level\n* The lower level is where the elite troops of the RDC are quartered. The rooms are arranged clockwise around the central stairwell and include Grand Secretary [[Atsura]]'s office, the war room, jail, exit to dock, kitchen, and barracks. The barracks are particularly notable for a high amount of stealable loot.\n* The exit on the southern side of this floor leads to an external walkway and shortcut to the main floor. At the top of the stairs is the orphaned dog [[Pes]].\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Hazanui Karū]]\n* [[Sabormi]], the quartermaster\n* Grand Secretary [[Atsura]]\n* [[Verzano]], overseer of \"Sanitary Engineering\". {{legacy|poe1}} Only appears if he is not killed during [[At All Costs]] in {{poe1}}.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=200px>\nPE2_Imperial_Command_Exterior.png | Building exterior\n</gallery>",
