To the northwest, where a tentacle of Wael's tears away a portion of the balcony, is the exit to the Deadfire Archipelago, while exits to other parts of the facility lie in the other cardinal directions: [[The Enclosures]] to the southwest, [[Hall of the Unseen]] to the southeast, and [[The Central Stacks]] in the northeast, with [[The Scriptorium]] stairs beyond.\n* In the center, around the fountain, are the archmages and their representatives: [[Tayn]] himself, [[Llengrath]], and [[Drowsy Puke]], representing [[Arkemyr]].\n* Note that deciding which wing to tackle first will determine who you face later on in the temple: Maura or Fyonlecg (Collections and Archives respectively).\n\n==Loot==\n\n[[Category:Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire dungeons]]",
