Its only major settlement is the small [[Huana]] village of [[Tikawara]], currently seeking to form close bonds with the VTC.\n\n==Locations==\n* [[File:Icon Tikawara.png|50px|left]] '''[[Tikawara]]''': A small colony of [[Huana]].<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Waterfall.png|50px|left]] '''[[Hōhina Ravine]]''': A treacherous stretch of mountainous territory occupied by lagufaeth.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n;Points of interest \n* [[File:Icon Cliffs Tropical.png|50px|left]] '''[[Sunepū Beach]]''': A large beach infested by lagufaeths. When you first come across it, it's completely unoccupied. You can use athletics to continue cautiously, perception and survival to investigate your surroundings, or cipher talents to scan for other minds. You will find a single, huge lagufaeth there, called [[Skulking-Terror]].<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Cliffs.png|50px|left]] '''[[Boa Hika Pass]]''': An area where you can engage a particularly ornery group of lagufaeths, hunting boars, led by [[Chief Echoing-Strike]].<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Forest Dark.png|50px|left]] '''[[Toaku Biwha Trail]]''': A scripted interaction where you can encounter delemgans and interact with them (or scare them off with 4 Intimidate).<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Burial Mound.png|50px|left]] '''Burial Site''': To the northeast.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n\n;On other islands\n* [[File:Icon Ruined Tower.png|50px|left]] '''Ruined Tower''': On the island to the southwest.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n* [[File:Icon Abandoned Village.png|50px|left]] '''Abandoned Village''': On the island to the northwest.<br clear=\"left\"/>\n==Quests==\n* [[The Storms of Poko Kohara]]\n* [[Broodmother's Fury]]\n* [[Plucked Fruit]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* The large bay on the northern side of the central island is called \"Ngati Tara Bay\". The label is present in the [[Backer Beta]], but not in the full game.\n* The Tehiwai Islands were named the [[Kua o Rikuhu Islands]] during the beta.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n PE2 Tehiwai Islands Tikawara.png | Central island\n PE2 Tikawara SW.png | Southwest island\n PE2 Tikawara SE.png | Southeast island\n PE2 Tikawara Abandoned N.png | Northeast island\n</gallery>",
