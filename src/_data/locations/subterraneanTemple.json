It is located to the northeast of [[Tikawara]], at the coordinates 19° 37' S, 64° 21' E.\n\n==Background==\n{{Description|After traipsing through a barren desert for several hours, you come upon an Engwithan ruin in the center of a clearing.\n\nAs you near, you realize the door to the ruin's entrance is emblazoned with the broken crown of Woedica.\n\nThe door swings open at your approach, and you immediately feel an oppressive presence butting against your mind. It tests your mental defenses, searching for a gap to exploit.\n\nThen, just as quickly as the presence arrives, it's gone.}}\nThis ancient temple to [[Woedica]] has served the Engwithan people of the archipelago before the millenia. Now it only serves a group of former members of the [[Steel Garrote]].\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a small temple, with most of it blocked off. The chamber leading to Gulfaryc has a single trap in the floor, with another inside, where the ex-Garrote members are. The treasure they protect, [[Magistrate's Cudgel]], is on the knees of the statue.\n* With [[Modwyr]] equipped, examining the cudgel will prompt some dialogue from her. She says that whatever the weapon is, it's \"...really, really stupid. And disgusting.\"\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Gulfaryc]], [[Arnfryda]], [[Blidh]], [[Carmet]], Yonga, all formerly members of [[The Steel Garrote]].\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Magistrate's Cudgel]]: On the statue. Need Intellect 14 and Resolve 15 to collect (otherwise, Resolve 17 to force it to leave).\n\n==Gallery==\n;Entering the temple\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\n 05 SII tower door 01.png\n 05 SII tower door 02.png\n</gallery>",
