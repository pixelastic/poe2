The lower section served as a combat arena during the confrontation with the forgotten archmage. The chamber to the northeast contains a pedestal that can be activated with [[Bekarna's Depleted Grimoire]] (must be during the night otherwise it will not be able to absorb enough starlight) and the northwestern corner has the stairs leading down to [[The Scriptorium]].\n\n==Loot==\n* [[The Mask of the Weyc]]: On the forgotten archmage.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oratory of Wael, The}}",
