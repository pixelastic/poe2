It is located on the northernmost player-nameable island of the [[Magran's Teeth]] island chain (at the coordinates 7'30\" N, 47'3\" E).\n\n==Background==\nA center of worship for the [[naga]], these ancient ruins have been the home of the naga for generations. Now you can wipe them all out and claim their riches for yourself.\n\n==Points of interest==\n;Exterior\n* The exterior of the mountain has to be scaled to encounter the naga - and if you're unlucky with your grenade throw, plenty of bats. The naga sorcerer drops the [[Sungrazer]]. Once he's out of the way, you can enter the temple proper.\n;Temple\n* The temple's divided into two major chambers. The front chamber contains the advance guard - plenty of hardened naga - and the inner, behind a firewall trap. Be sure to loot the bodies for the unique battle axe and cloak!\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Uvaala]], a naga shaman \n\n==Loot==\n* [[Sungrazer]]: Dropped by the shaman found outdoors\n* [[Rekvu's Scorched Cloak]]: Dropped by [[Uvaala]].\n* [[Magran's Favor]]:  Looted from the adventurer's corpse at the stairs to the altar.\n* [[Flame NƒÅga Hatchling]]: Looted from an unmarked egg on the temple altar.",
