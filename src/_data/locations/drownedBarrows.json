Scavenger birds circle high above its peak in a morbid halo.\nAs you approach the base of the mountain, the beating of drums reverberates from the skull's gaping mouth and vacant eye sockets.}} This oddly shaped mountain is the heart of Nemnok's domain.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* You can enter the barrows via [[Junvik Village]], it cannot be accessed from the sea due to the shallow water surrounding the area.\n* You can enter either through the mouth or through the sockets. The sockets place you at the Crown, with the left giving you a chance to talk to the scriveners, the right skipping straight to the fighting. Entering the left socket requires either a [[Rope and Grappling Hook (Deadfire)|Rope and Grappling Hook]], or an [[Athletics]] 12 check on all party members. Of those that fail, the party member with the worst Athletics rating will get a [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Injury|Twisted Ankle]] (-20 [[Reflex]]). Upon entering, one member of the party will comment on their surroundings.\n;Crown\n* There are two distinct sections up here: The left eye and the right eye. The left eye contains the scriptorium under the lead of [[Acolyte Kinnuq]]. Talk to him to learn how to get to Nemnok. You can also pilfer [[Kinnuq's Memo]] from the table.\n* The scrivener quarters/barracks are to the northeast, with [[A Note on the Forge]] on the barrel, referring to the naga under [[Forgemaster Tythus]] below. The area beyond the scriveners workroom is hostile, though, so be ready for dwarven casters and [[eoten]]. The lower right edge of the map contains the right eye, which is used as a storage area and contains plenty of traps.\n* Another room, the \"hidden study\", is to the far northeast, though it is inaccessible from this level and has to be entered via a hidden stairway on the base floor (see below). Once you're in, grab [[Nemnok's Cloak]], and a [[Blackwood Log]] from the crates.\n;Base floor\n* The base floor is filled with hostiles, including dwarven scriveners and [[Eoten dweller|eoten]]. While the entrance to Nemnok's sanctuary is straight ahead from the entrance, you'll have to deal with the Sigil of Death there (either with a [[Sigil of Death Wardstone|wardstone]], or with ranged, non-piercing damage), as well as a few traps on the floor.\n* The left corridor leads to a small shrine to Nemnok and stairs leading up to the Crown, while the right one grants access to the naga forge, eoten guard post with [[Deathwarden Latuc]]. After the bridge, you can blow up the barrels to find a hidden switch (requires [[Perception]] 10 to detect) which reveals a bricked-over stairway leading to the hidden study in the crown. Watch out for traps!\n;Sanctum\n* A large chamber with the statue of Nemnok overlooking the summoning pit. As you approach the pit, Kaali will interrupt you and engage in dialogue.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Acolyte Kinnuq]], head of the scriveners\n* [[Forgemaster Tythus]], leader of the flame nāga\n* [[Deathwarden Latuc]], eoten with the privilege of visiting Nemnok\n* [[Kaali]], the abducted acolyte\n* [[Nemnok the Devourer]]\n\n==Enemies==\n;Base floor\n* Wilder\n** [[Eoten Dweller]] (x6, including Deathwarden Latuc)\n** [[Flame Nāga Disciple]] (x3)\n** [[Flame Nāga Sentinel]] (x2)\n** [[Flame Nāga Sorcerer]] (x1, Forgemaster Tythus)\n* Kith\n** [[Barrows Guard]] (x6)\n** [[Scrivener Warlock]] (x4)\n** [[Scrivener Acolyte]] (x4)\n\n;Crown\n* [[Wilder]]\n** [[Eoten Dweller]] (x2)\n* [[Kith]]\n** [[Barrows Guard]] (x3)\n** [[Scrivener Acolyte]] (x2)\n** [[Scrivener Warlock]]\n\n;Sanctum\n* [[Wilder]]\n** [[Eoten Dweller]] (x2)\n** [[Flame Nāga Sentinel]] (x2)\n* [[Kith]]\n** [[Barrow's Guard]]\n** [[Scrivener Acolyte]]\n** [[Scrivener Warlock]]\n** Worshipper (x8)\n* [[Primordials]]\n** [[Nemnok the Devourer]]\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Nemnok's Cloak]] and [[Blackwood Log]]: In the hidden study area of the crown (accessed via the bricked-over stairway on the base floor - see above).\n* [[Superb War Hammer (Deadfire)|Superb War Hammer]]: Crown, in a chest south of the barracks.\n* [[Superb Great Sword (Deadfire)|Superb Great Sword]]: Hidden on an anvil in the forge area of the base floor.\n* [[Veilpiercer]], [[Chromoprismatic Quarterstaff]], [[Mundane Shell]]: Found in the sanctum area. One can be chosen as a reward for completing [[The Lost Grimoires]], or they can be taken by force.\n\n==Gallery==\n;Scripted interaction graphics\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\n 28 si drowned barrows establishing.png\n 28_si_drowned_barrows_figure.png\n 28 si drowned barrows eye left.png\n 28 si drowned barrows eye right.png\n</gallery>",
