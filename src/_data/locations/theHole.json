As far as the Gullet goes, it's an historic place that's been there as long as the district's been hanging above the chasm.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The large common room of the tavern is filled with patrons, including a slumming Rauataian crew, with [[Fyrna]] keeping a close eye over them and their behavior, in accordance with the two rules the Hole espouses: Keep your hands to yourself and don't fall into the shitter.\n* There's a kitchen in the northwestern corner, where you can snatch a piglet and hire an ogre cook. \n* The stairs to the upper floor are in the southeastern corner. The upper floor contains living rooms, with a pickable chamber to the southeast and [[Orron]] and his Goldpact Knights in the northwestern room. The first room on the right belongs to [[Giacolo]], and is ransacked during [[The Man of Chimes]].\n\n==Rooms==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Room\n! Cost\n!
