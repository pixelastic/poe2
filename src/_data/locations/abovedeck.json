It refers to the main deck of both ''[[The Defiant]]'' and other player ships.\n\nYou can access the ship by clicking the arrow at the top of the screen while on the world map. This will take you to the abovedeck, and will remove all companions from your party.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|The Defiant}}\nThe deck is the stage of the ship, and is where all the busy work on a ship occurs. Here you'll find a number of your companions and crew, a few of which are roaming about, earning their keep in maintaining the ship. Towards the rear of the boat is the sterncastle, a raised section containing stairs up to the poop deck (the platform above the sterncastle) and entrance to the captains quarters and [[belowdecks]].\n\nAbovedeck is where you'll see the result of all aesthetic and functional modifications to the ship.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[The Steward]]\n* Any crew members that are part of the current crew (and are not injured) will appear working on deck. Depending on their assigned job, a crew member will appear in a different position on the deck.\n\n===Companions===\nOn ''The Defiant'' (differs for some other, larger ships):\n* [[Maia]] and [[Ishiza]]\n* [[Mirke]]\n* [[Serafen]]\n* [[Tekehu]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=0\n!
