Jacob Harker converted his old family ship into a tavern, figuring he'll make more money using it that way, than by letting her rot in her berth.\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The area is compact, with all the usual amenities packed into the space that was once the hold of an old dhow. The central room occupies most of the space (where you witness a pirate discussion resolved in a very pirate way).\n* A gallery, the \"Officers' Perch\", overlooks it, containing a number of cozy booths for discreet dealings. The captain's cabin turned \"pleasure room\" offers romantic encounters, given you have the coin. A rudimentary game room is found opposite to the bar.\n\n==Rooms==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Room\n! Cost\n!
