Ofecchia offers plenty of vegetation and no civilization at all.\n\n==Locations==\n* Ofecchia offers several lootable areas, though no visible locations otherwise.\n\n==Trivia==\n* This island is only present in the [[Backer Beta]] world map. While the general shape exists in various forms (e.g. [[Crookspur Island]]), the island itself is not present in the same area on the map in the full game. There is an island in the same place (northwest of [[Tikawara]]), but it only matches in shape and geographical location - it is still rotated/scaled differently and has features unlike the island in the beta.",
