It is located on an unmarked island at the coordinates 21° 5'S, 51° 14'E. [[Tangaloa's Maw]] is to the east.\n\n==Background==\nAs the name suggests, this is a forgotten underground burial site in the middle of nowhere.\n{{Description|A lush, narrow valley lies below you. You spot an overgrown stone structure build into the valley's side in the distance.\n\nBefore the stone structure spreads a broad field peppered with ancient plinths and mounds of cracked stonework.\n\nAs you move closer, you discover that the stone structure is actually the entrance to a crypt. Though the doorway is thick with mud and as damp as sweat-slick skin, you continue down into the dark.}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n* This isn't a big location: The central throne room is where the [[Death Guard]] fanatic has established his lair, gathering various valuables and other baubles. He drops the [[Reckless Brigandine]]. Oh, and there's also undead all over.\n* In the center is a Sigil of Atrophy, which applies [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Curses|Curse of Atrophy]] (-2 Might, stacks up to 5 times). Destroy it from a distance, or use a [[Sigil of Atrophy Wardstone]] to mitigate it's effects. There are traps surrounding it which causes it to attack if stepped on, these attacks cause [[Status effects (Deadfire)#Serious Burn|Serious Burn]] (-2 Dexterity, -3 Burn Armor Rating). When the sigil is destroyed, the traps are deactivated.\n* Upon leaving the catacombs, you get to name the island as part of [[Mapping the Archipelago: Tikawara]].\n\n==Enemies==\n;Wilder\n* [[Revenant ogre]] (x2)\n;Vessel\n* [[Fampyr (Deadfire)|Fampyr]] (x2)\n* [[Dargul (Deadfire)|Dargul]] (x5)\n* [[Death guard fanatic|Death Guard Fanatic]]\n;Other\n* [[Sigil of Atrophy]]: In the center.\n\n==Loot==\n;Looted from the Death Guard Fanatic\n* [[Reckless Brigandine]]\n* [[Exceptional War Bow (Deadfire)|Exceptional War Bow]]\n* [[Exceptional Battle Axe (Deadfire)|Exceptional Battle Axe]]\n* [[Exceptional Mace (Deadfire)|Exceptional Mace]]\n;Other\n* [[Scroll of Kalakoth's Minor Blights]], [[Spire Sponge]]: Central area, in a hidden Urn.\n* [[Potion of Improved Arcane Reflection]]: Central area, sarcophagus.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n RE si uncharted 03 crypt.png | The entrance to the catacombs.\n PE2 Tangaloa's Maw Island.png | The island containing Forgotten Catacomb\n</gallery>",
