Though housing the castes packed together the Rauatai way has stressed a number of Huana, it has also steadily eroded caste divisions leading to new friendships and transfer of skills - though the Mataru once heading the village cannot conceal his disdain for ''equality''. \n\n==Points of interest==\n* This is a single, long building with characters spread out across. The elitist Mataru occupies the fanciest single quarters at the head of the building.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Watūri]], [[Osauro]], and [[Nedunga]]\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Superb War Hammer (Deadfire)|Superb War Hammer]]: In a locked chest in [[Watūri]]'s room - requires [[Mechanics]] 13. You can easily grab it while he's out of the room, inspecting the armoire in the hall.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=200px>\nPE2_Huana_Longhouse_Exterior.png | Building exterior\n</gallery>",
