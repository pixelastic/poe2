It is inhabited by a peculiar cult of [[Rymrgand]], zealously devoted to death and dying, led by an endings godlike called [[Vatnir]].\n\n==Points of interest==\n* The village is small, centered around [[Harbingers' Retreat]], the common house. To the southwest is a statue of Rymrgand create by [[Harbinger Leksi]], with [[Harbingers' dwelling]] below. The fishmonger and brewer offer their wares along the stream to the northeast. The exit deeper into the glacier is located on the northwestern ice wall, and requires [[Vatnir's icepicks]] to pass through.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Harbinger Hafjórn]], the local butcher and greeter\n* [[Harbinger Leksi]], ice sculptor\n* [[Harbinger Karlódh]], fishmonger\n* [[Harbinger Nyvardir]], brewer\n;Rest\n* [[Vatnir]]\n* [[Harbinger Valbrendhür]]\n;Dwelling\n* [[Harbinger Brythe]]\n\n==Loot==\n* [[Permafrost shard]]: Rafters in the Retreat.",
